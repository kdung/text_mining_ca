202475000,Employee Fractures Leg When Struck By Metal Pipes,"At 12:00 p.m.   on April 3  2008  Employee #1  a 41-year-old male yard  supervisor assisted in unloading a pipe out of a rail car. His lower left leg  was caught between bundles of pipe stock placed near the railcar being  unloaded and a rail flat car. The accident occurred during the first shift as  the pipe was being unloaded from a railcar. Per company policy  Employee #1  worked with two other employees. Employee #1's job was to set the brake on the  railcar; Employee #3 was the spotter  and Employee #2 was the forklift driver  and the railcar positioner and pusher (using the forklift to hold the railcars  in position). The usual procedure was : Employee #2 pushes the railcars with  the forklift; Employee #3 watched and relayed the signal of Employee #1  who  set the brake on the railcar. At the time of the accident  Employee #1  signaled Employee #3 and disappeared from view. Employee #3 signalled Employee  #2  who released the forks of the forklift holding the railcars. Employee #2  realized when he moved his forklift back  that the railcars came ""with him""   meaning that that the brakes had not been applied. Employee #1 sustained  serious injuries. The front of his leg was struck by the rungs of the ladder  he was attempting to climb and the back of his leg was struck by stacked  bundles of pipe that were placed on the ground  behind and close to the rail  flatcar. This resulted in an open fracture of his left leg. Several factors  contributed to the   1) No written procedures and safety training on  railcar positioning and unloading of railcars was done prior to the accident.  2) The railcars were not chocked or otherwise prevented from moving. 3) Pipe  bundles were permitted to remain on the ground adjacent to a track at a  distance less than 8 feet 6 inches from the center line of track. %09",railroad car  rail  struck by  leg  fracture  flatbed rail car  chock,,yard supervisor,,,yard supervisor

201792710,Three Employees Fall Unconcious,"On September 26  1999  Employee #1  Employee #2  and Employee #3 were  participating in a training drill. All three employees were assigned to the  decontamination team  which is responsible for decontaminating hazardous  materials response members. The team was suited in level B protective gear and  was utilizing Self Contained Breathing Apparatus. The team was using a ""buddy  breather"" system  which allowed the team to switch from breathing air from a  cylinder to an airline drawing air from Air Utility-21 air tanks. The Air  Utility-21 airline system consisted of 300 ft of Synflex hose (an internal  part of system)  a manifold  and three separate 75-ft portable Gates Premoflex  airline hoses. The manifold was capable of splitting the compressor's airlines  into five 50-ft lines; however for the purpose of this drill  three 75-ft  lines were used. Employee #1 was the first of the three team members to switch  to breathing air from the Air Utility-21 airline. Employees #2 and #3 switched  onto the airline a few seconds later. Employee #1 reported that after  approximately 10 seconds  he began to feel dizzy. Employee #1 stopped and bent  over to rest and informed Employees #2 and #3 to suit-up. Employee #1 recalls  walking away from Employee #2 and #3  stumbling and tripping. Employee #1 then  fell  face-forward  onto the floor  but does not remember this. The impact of  Employee #1's fall resulted in a laceration to his nose and forehead caused by  the impact of his face hitting his respirator face piece. This injury required  stitches. The next thing Employee #1 remembered was being aware of firemen  picking him up and providing him with first aid. Employee #2 connected to the  airline after Employee #1. Employee #2 recalls that after approximately two  breaths  he began to feel dizzy and thought that he may have stood up to  quickly which he reasoned was the cause of his dizziness. After a dozen more  breaths  Employee #2 felt lightheaded  nauseated  dizzy  and had hazy vision.  Employee #2 then looked towards Employees #1 and #3 to see what they were  doing and disconnected himself from the airline. Employee #2 took a few steps  towards Employee #3 and yelled at him to ""go off air."" Employee #2 then  realized Employee #1 was down on the floor. Employee #3 switched over to  breathe air off of the airline shortly after Employee #2. After one or two  breaths  Employee #3 recalls having difficulty with his manual dexterity   having a hard time attaching a hook that holds his breathing apparatus  and  felt that he had tunnel vision. After approximately 10 seconds of breathing  air from the airline  Employee #2 yelled at him to disconnect himself from the  airline. Employee #3 disconnected from the airline  estimating that he had  breathed air from the line for no more than 15 seconds. At this time  he  noticed that Employee #1 was on the ground. Paramedics were present at the  drill and took the vitals of all three team members and placed them on oxygen  for 20 minutes.

202532305,Two Employees Are Injured In Chemical Fire,At approximately 7:00 p.m. on September 23  2013  Employee #1 and #2 were  working at a chemical production facility. The production manager told a  coworker to place an obsolete trigonox 5-gallon container into the waste room.  The coworker poured the trigonox into a 55-gallon waste drum between 10:00  a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on that day. There were two waste drums (liquid and solid)  in the waste area adjacent to the compounding room. The liquid waste drum  contained left over liquid chemicals from a chemical batch that included  methyl methacrylate  ethyl acrylic  and trigonox 101  (2 5-Dimethyl-2 5-di(tert-butylperoxy)hexane). Both methyl methacrylate and  ethyl acrylic are flammable liquids. Around 7:00 p.m.  the chemicals in the  drum reacted and accelerated due to a catalyst in the drum. The runaway  reaction overpressurized the drum  causing it to fail and rupture and ejecting  drum lid. The drum lid struck the ceiling and hit a steam pipe  which resulted  in a fire. The vapors of methyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylic are heavier  than air  and travel down to the underground drain from the waste area into  the compounding room. Employee #1 was working at the filling station under the  hood in the compounding room. The fire from the underground drain melted  chemical filled plastic tubs on racks in the filling station. The fire had  grown bigger because there was more fuel (flammable chemicals) at the filling  station. Employee #1 tried to get out of the compounding room as fast as he  could after the fire. He suffered second-degree burns to his face and back of  his head  and third-degree burns to his right shoulder  arm  and fingers.  Employee #2 was in the compounding room to check Employee #1's work when fire  happened. The fire caused the power to shut down to the exit door. Employee #2  could not get out of the room. Other employees outside the compounding room  knew that he was inside the room  so they tried to push the door open. When  Employee #3 saw a crack of light at the door  he pushed himself to door and  got out of the room. Employee #3 suffered second-degree burns to his right  arm  third-degree burns to his right ear  right side of face  and serious  respiratory problems.

Coworker #3 parked  his flatbed tractor trailer  which was loaded with counterweights and a  section of boom  parallel to the crane  approximately 10 ft away. They began  to set up the crane and coworker #1 raised the 50 ft boom and swung it towards  the truck so that coworker #3 could release the travel slings from the main  and auxiliary lines. At this point the main block and the headache ball were  both approximately 1 ft from the truck  in between the truck and the crane.  The main block was approximately 25 ft above the ground and had two 20 ft  slings attached to lift the counterweights for the crane. Employee #1 was  standing on top of the stacked counterweights on the trailer  approximately 8  or 9 ft above the ground. He was inserting hooks that would be used to lift  the counterweights. The auxiliary line was hoisted with the 750 pound headache  ball attached to a height of approximately 40 ft in order to get it out of the  way. The left foot brake pedal for the auxiliary line failed to latch  properly. The parking brake takes 2 to 3 seconds to bleed off air and  completely set. The auxiliary line and headache ball began to free fall. The  ball glanced off of the main block kicking it towards Employee#1.

The breaker failed and they decided to replace it. Employee #2 and #3 removed the cover and exposed energized parts of the 600 amp breaker. There was a 900 amp breaker at the bottom of the switchboard marked with Emergency Service Disconnect above the breaker and Panel DEQH Equipment Branch below the breaker, which made the electricians think the breaker would turn off the power to the switchboard. Employee #2 turned off the 900 amp breaker and tested the 600 amp breaker with a voltmeter to confirm it was deenergized, but found it was still energized. They decided to remove the 900 amp breaker cover to determine why it was still energized. Employee #2 and #3 were on their knees on either side of the switchboard. While kneeling by the switchboard, they removed the cover above the 900 amp breaker when an electrical arc was produced. The electric arc struck Employee #2 and threw him to the floor, causing him head contusions. Employee #1 received minor burns to his abdomen. Employee #3 received second and third degree burns to his face, neck and forearms outside his cotton t-shirt. The switchboard arced, burned, and smoked until the power was shut off. All three employees had breathing difficulties related to smoke inhalation. The employees had no training on hazards associated with working near exposed energized parts.

202349858,Employees Injured From Chemical Release,"On June 13  2001  Employees #1 through #7 were working near a sodium  hypochlorite tank. Employee #1 was operating a tanker truck containing 4000  gallons of ferric chloride. He drove his truck onto the facility and stopped  at the administration and control building. After talking with the  receptionist  she contacted the supervisor of the facility and asked him to  take Employee #1 to the delivery site. However  the supervisor escorted him to  the sodium hypochlorite building and pump station  which was near the ferric  chloride delivery building. The supervisor told the Employee #1 to hook up to  the middle fitting on the side of the sodium hypochlorite building. The middle  fitting had a sign with ""hypo"" written on it hanging from the fitting.  Employee #1 asked the supervisor several times about whether this was the  correct place to unload the ferric chloride  and he was told it was the  correct place. Employee #1 hooked up to the hypo fitting and began unloading  the ferric chloride into sodium hypochlorite tank. About 400 gallons of ferric  chloride were unloaded before he noticed a cloud forming around the hookup. He  ran into the cloud to stop the unloading and then went for help. Chlorine gas  had formed from the reaction between ferric chloride and the sodium  hypochlorite. Other employee observed the cloud formation and informed the  supervisor. The supervisor got his respirator and went to the hypochlorite  building to check the situation out. The supervisor put on the respirator   which was a full-face chemical respirator with chlorine cartridges  but donned  no other personal protective equipment. However  the respirator was not  suitable for the situation; as he got close to the scene  the supervisor  smelled something through his mask. He left the area and went to find another  employee  who was the chief of operations  to report the problem. The chief of  operations responded by donning just a self-contained breathing apparatus and  went into the building to check the tanks for leaks. The chief of operations  felt the skin on his legs begin to get hot within a short time  so he left the  building and went back to the administration building to wait for the  hazardous material responders to arrive. Employees and management said the  chlorine alarm at the building sounded  but no one knew at what level the  alarm was set to go off. Hazmat teams and fire departments arrived at the  building and gained control of the situation. Four employees were exposed to  the chlorine gas and were experiencing minor health effects. They were  transported to the hospital for observation. Two of these employees showered  and changed clothes at the plant before they went to the hospital. A fifth  employee who had been near the incident site had left the plant after his  shift and went to the hospital.

201020294,Employee Injured In Fall,At approximately 11:00 a.m. on October 6  2004  Employee #1 and two other  nearby employees  Employee #2 and Employee #3  were all working at different  workstations approximately twenty feet apart at the Bergy Door & Window  Company. Employee #1 was preparing to trim the bottom of a solid core 3068  alder plank door. He put the door on the table of his workstation and then  started to reposition it. Picking the door up with both hands  he stepped back  from the table  felt his foot catch on something  and fell. Employee #3 had  his back to Employee #1 but  hearing a loud noise  knew from experience that a  door had fallen. He turned to see Employee #1 on the floor. He went over to  Employee #1  who said that he had been walking backward carrying the door and  tripped when his foot caught on the mat. Employee #3 and another employee  helped Employee #1 to his feet. Employee #1 stood holding the edge of the  table. Employee #1 didn't remember being in too much pain  although Employee  #3 remembered that Employee #1 complained of lightheadedness. Employee #1 was  taken to Kaiser Hospital  where it was determined that he required surgery for  a broken hip. The site is a door factory originally started by the current  employer's father in 1952. The current employer took the business over from  his father in 1972. Employees (millworkers) use table saws  radial arm saws   joiners  sanders  router and drills during the course of the workday. Work  hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The workday starts with a production  meeting after which the employees disperse to the various workstations. On the  day of the accident  Employee #1 reported to work as usual. Neither of two  witnesses reports anything unusual about him during the morning meeting  and  Employee #1 himself does not recall anything out of the ordinary. Employee #1  was working at a workstation different from the one he normally did. All  workstations  though  are essentially similar  and the work performed at each  is the same. The floor is concrete  and the area around each table is covered  with 0.375 in.-thick rubber mats to increase traction and ease the strain from  standing. At the time of the accident  Employee #1 was wearing safety goggles   gloves with a rubber face grip to help him hold doors  and track shoes.  Employee #1 walks with a shuffling gait due to neurological damage from a  prior stroke. It is possible that this gait disturbance did not allow him to  clear the edge of the mat  and when his right foot caught on the mat  the door  he was carrying overbalanced him and caused him to fall to the floor. Employee  #1 was employed off and on by the employer for a number of years. He was  recently rehired in 2003 and continued to work up until the day of the  accident. Regulatory Action and Accident-related Violations: There were no  accident related violations found as the result of this accident. The employer  was cited for a violation of 3203 (b)(2): Documentation of employee training  was not maintained. The accident was reported to Cal/OSHA in a timely fashion.

202508719,Employee Is Crushed When Trapped By Drilling Rig,At 8:00 a.m. on July 5  2011  Employee #1 sustained a crushing injury to his  ribs. The accident site is a natural gas drilling well site where the employer  was servicing a well. The work at the time of injury was the setting up of the  drill rig over the natural gas well. Employee #1 and Employee #3 were placing  nuts on the blow out preventer. Employee #2 was spotting the drill rig as it  move backward. Employee #4 was the driver of the drilling rig. Employee #5   the supervisor  was walking away from the drill rig towards the Dog House  (i.e. trailer) at the time of the accident. The employees were beginning the  task of erecting the mast platform for Drill Rig #8. The employees began to  back the drilling rig's vertical platform into place at the back end of the  rig. The high pressure blow out preventer  which resembles a Christmas tree in  shape due to its extruding flanges and pipes  was put over the well head.  Employee #1 and Employee #3 began tightening a series of nuts requiring manual  tightening with large wrenches at the blow out devise. Employee #1 was wrench  tightening bolts to the blow out preventer as the drill rig slowly backed up.  Employee #2 was directing the drill rig driver  Employee #4  to the correct  location to set up over the well head. Employee #1 was out of view of the  drill rig driver  Employee #4. When Employee #4 attempted to put on the Drill  Rig #8's brakes to stop the drill rig  the air brakes failed to engage.  Employee #4 immediately knew the air brakes were not working  which caused him  to pull the drill rig's hand brake to stop the rig. The extra distance the  drill rig moved due to the faulty air brakes was approximately two feet. The  additional two feet moved was enough distance to trap Employee #1 between the  core of the blow out devise and the drill rig platform. Employee #1 sustained  a crushing injury with broken ribs and a possible concussion. The other  employees removed Employee #1 from the pinned position and kept Employee #1  still until medical care arrived.

200376507,Four Workers Sustain Cuts When Glass Meter Shatters,On or about June 21  2013  Employees #1  #2  and #3  electrical power  installers  plus Employee #4  who was the work crew superintendent  plus  Coworkers #1  #2  and #3  all of Utec Constructors Corporation  were  installing insulation to electrical power transmission lines. The lines were  in eight conduits along a road. Nitrogen was being used for the insulation. An  18-wheel trailer contained 10 tubes of nitrogen  with a total volume of  approximately 100 000 cubic feet. Four of the workers were standing on or  around the back of the trailer  and the superintendent was standing along the  left side of the trailer. Two workers were in a manhole and operating valves  where a hose attached to the manifold on the back of the trailer. The  superintendent instructed the crew to open the valves. He then noticed that  the valve on the manifold in line behind the nitrogen flow meter was leaking.  He said to close the valve  meaning to close the valve on the nitrogen tube.  Instead  the valve on the conduit in the manhole was closed. Closing this  valve caused a buildup of pressure. As a result of this pressure  the glass  portion of the flow meter failed and shattered. When the glass shattered   Employees #1  #2  #3  and #4 were struck by flying glass. They were  transported to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC Health).  Employees #1  #2  and #4 were treated for cuts and bruises to the face  and  Employee #3 was treated for cuts to the left wrist. Employee #1 was admitted  for an overnight stay. Employees #2  #3  and #4 were released without  hospitalization. At the time of this report  all the injured employees were  continuing to recover. The subsequent investigation determined that the  nitrogen flow meter was manufactured by SK Micrometer. The investigator was  unable to verify the model number  which had been on the glass that shattered.  All employees were wearing appropriate PPE  including hard hats  safety  glasses  and work boots. The two employees in the manhole were also wearing  harnesses and lanyards.

The cold room is a closed environment with recirculated air.  It has two doors that are opposite of each other and each door is equipped  with a pleated drive through plastic curtain. After working in the cold room  for approximately 45 to 60 minutes  the three employees became ill. Employee  #1 and #3 manifested clinical signs of carbon monoxide exposure  and Employee  #2 became unconscious  with gurgling. Employee #1 and #2 were air lifted to  Fresno Community Regional Medical Center  while Employee #3 was taken to  Sierra View Hospital. The supervisor was in the cold room at the beginning of  the inventory check and noted that the forklift was operating properly. Upon  reentry into the cold room  the supervisor noted that the south exterior door  was closed  which is in conflict with the employer's directives. The forklift  appeared to be in good repair and was maintained on a regular schedule by PEPE  Materials Handling  a Hyster franchisor. A PEPE forklift technician  using an  exhaust analyzer  determined that the carbon monoxide output was 8  which is  above the allowable exhaust emissions of 2  that is established in 8CCR  5145(c) for a 100 to 140 cubic-inch internal combustion engine. The  combination of carbon monoxide emissions  in conjunction with the closed  doors  was identified as the cause of exposure.

201146065,Four Employees Are Injured In Ethylene Oxide Explosion,"At approximately 2:50 p.m. on August 19  2004  Employees #1  #2  #3  and #4  were working in a scrubber processing unit at Sterigenics in Ontario  CA.  Sterigenics utilizes ethylene oxide to sterilize medical equipment. Employees  #2  #3  and #4 were performing normal scrubber operation duties  and Employee  #1 was working in a supervisory capacity in the mezzanine control room.  Chamber number 7 of the scrubber indicated that it had not received an  ethylene oxide injection during a validation cycle. Maintenance employees were  summoned to troubleshoot the error. After performing various checks on the  chamber and system  the maintenance technician and maintenance supervisor  calibrated its SEC IR spectrometer to verify the operation of the  sterilization number 7 step. This procedure checks the ethylene oxide  injection into the sterilization chambers and comprises of several  verification phases. The gas inject phase involves the injection of  approximately 125 lb of ethylene oxide into the chamber  which is followed by  a gas dwell phase. In the vacuum phase  approximately 50 lb of the gas is  evacuated from the room to a scrubber  and then the scrubber goes into a  vacuum hold phase. The vacuum phase checks the ability of the chamber to  maintain vacuum condition. It involves the injection of three gases  including  nitrogen and or steam to remove the ethylene oxide from the sterilization  chamber  and then the final release  in which a minimal amount of residual  ethylene oxide is flushed using air. The residual ethylene oxide and air  mixture is sent to a fired catalytic oxidizer that react the residual ethylene  oxide to neutralize it. Employee #5 verified that the gas dwell phase and  vacuum phase ran correctly and requested the permissive password for  authorization to advance the procedure cycles to final release. Employee #5  received the permissive password from Employee #6 and advanced the cycles   bypassing the gas or ""safety"" washes. Employee #5 then proceeded to open the  chamber door on chamber number 7. Opening the chamber door causes a blower to  send air through the chamber and blow any residual gases to the fired  catalytic oxidizer. A high concentration of approximately 62 lb of ethylene  oxide was routed from the sterilization chamber number 7 to the fired  catalytic oxidizer  resulting in an explosion and extensive structural and  equipment damage. The explosion caused injuries to the employees located near  by the scrubber processing unit. Some of the employees received injuries that  included contusions and lacerations from flying glass and debris as a result  of the explosion.",maintenance  cleaning  laceration  flammable vapors  ethylene oxide  gas leak  explosion,3 305354615   Non Hospitalized injury Cut/Laceration Occupation not reported,,,,

200376481,Three Employees Suffer Burns When Sprayed By Hot Water,At approximately 8:00 a.m. on August 15  2013  Employees #1 and #4 were  setting up two vessels  diaphragm pumps  and hoses to perform a test water  heating procedure in the pilot plant area at Pulcra Chemicals  LLC. No  chemicals were used during the testing. This was not the employee's usual job  task. The vessels that were being used were a 100 gallon atmospheric mixing  vessel and a 350 gallon International bulk container (IBC) tote. The set-up  was conducted to test the heating of water in the 100 gallon mixing vessel to  approximately 80 degree Celsius and 176 degrees Fahrenheit by using steam  heated water from the IBC tote and circulating it through the jacket on the  100 gallon vessel using pumps. On the lid there was a 3 in. metal filling cap  that housed a 5:1 vent pressure relief valve that was set to activate at 5 lbs  per square inch of pressure. There was not a pressure gauge on the IBC tote  and it contained decals that stated Caution do not pressurize this tank. This  unit had a temperature gauge on it. At approximately 9:00 a.m.  Employee #1  filled the IBC tote with approximately 250 to 275 gallons of water. The tote  did not contain a fill gauge and the employee filled the unit so that it would  not have to be refilled for the duration of the heating process. The employee  began the heating procedure. The water in the 100 gallon vessel began to heat  up when the temperature gauge read 30 to 40 degrees Celsius and 86 to 104  degrees Fahrenheit. At this time  Employee #1 alerted Employees #2 and #3 that  the process was underway.

200210052,Employees Injured After Inhaling Hydrogen Fluoride,"Employees #1 through #7 were working between one and four blocks away from an alkylation unit, which was operating as usual. An worker in that unit had been instructed to block in the flow transmitter 83 FC 102, which was connected to a 2 in. internal hydrogen fluoride regeneration line at an orifice plate. He was to close the two 90 degree block valves, which were stubbed off the high and low sides of the flanged orifice plate, and open the two 90 degree bleed valves on both the high and low sides of the differential pressure instrument. According to the operators, there were no valve handles on the two 90 degree block valves because of physical interference from adjacent equipment. The worker that was to block in the instrument apparently failed to close one or both of the block valves before he opened the bleed valves. A vapor cloud of hydrogen fluoride developed. The leak continued for about five minutes, with the release of approximately 100 lb of hydrogen fluoride. A water deluge was used to minimize the vapor cloud. No injuries were reported in the alkylation unit, but Employees #1 through #7, who were working downwind, sustained minor inhalation injuries. On May 26, 1996, Citgo reported that all but two of the seven employees would be released from Memorial Hospital.

Employee #1 went to the operations office and was told that the blind  was ready to be pulled. Employee #2 gathered the proper tools and checked the  vacuum gauge to confirm that the line had 20 inches of vacuum. Neither the  maintenance supervisor nor the operations foreman initiated a fresh air permit  check  which would have indicated if type B protection would be necessary.  Instead  they believed that type C protection would be adequate since they had  used it on previous occasions for this job. Employee #1 used a wrench to  remove seven of the eight bolts holding the blind without any leakage. When he  removed the last bolt  hydrogen fluoride mist struck him in the face. Employee  #2 was standing by with the water hose and was also hit in the face by  hydrogen fluoride. Both employees suffered chemical burns and Employee #1 was  hospitalized. The bleeder line from this pump had become plugged and had never  been repaired. This meant that the upper side of the pump was still under  pressure and the vacuum was only being drawn from the lower side of the pump.

201062593,Three Employees Injured When Vapors Ignited,Three employees of a polymeric floor coating application contractor were  seriously burned while using an electric floor buffer. The employees were  using a methyl ethyl ketone solvent to strip an uncured floor when the vapors  from the solvent ignited from a spark from the floor buffer. All three  employees were working inside a small bathroom  approximately 1 000 cubic ft   when the fire occurred. Employee #1 was operating a floor buffer with brush  attachment. The buffer was a Waxie Model 17  a 17-in. electric floor buffer  with a 1-horse power  120-volt electrical motor. The motor was an induction  motor  but started with a centrifugal switch that is capable of sparking.  Employee #1 was operating the floor buffer  while Employee #2 and Employee #3  poured the solvent onto the floor and then wiped behind the buffer with rags.  Employee #1 suffered severe second-and-third-degree burns to 20 percent of his  body. Employees #2 and #3 suffered similar injuries over a smaller percent of  their body. The accident occurred at a customer's premises  during working  hours. The fire caused significant damage to the bathroom  detaching a locked  door and separating it from the door frame. The three employees were wearing  half-mask respirators with an inappropriate cartridge  short-sleeve shirts   latex exam gloves and the only source of ventilation was from a ceiling fan  rated at 6 to 9 air changes per hour. The employer had no safety plan for  performing the floor stripping operation and did not bring portable  ventilation to the site. When the employee's eyes became irritated  they  donned swimming goggles purchased from a sporting goods store in the vicinity  and continued to work until the fire occurred.,burn  mek  vapor  fire  spark  ventilation  ppe,1 125999391   Hospitalized injury Burn/Scald(Heat) Construction trades  n.e.c.

They were in containment  working about 200 ft above the water and  approximately 50 ft below the road bed. The employees were spraying a  salt-water sealer comprised of 70 percent toluene and 25 percent methyl ethyl  ketone (MEK) on a new paint job when the flammable liquid caught on fire. All  three employees sustained burns  but none were hospitalized. The employer said  the source of ignition was the lighting on the job site.

200261444,Employees Burned By Erupting Molten Metal,At approximately 11:34 a.m. on December 22  2000  Employee #1  #2 and #3 had  initiated a metal casting process in the casting pit when molten metal erupted  from the pit. The process was a semi-continuous direct chill casting process.  An electric arc casting furnace was used to melt copper raw material. The  copper was poured from the furnace into a launder (pouring tundish) and then  into three copper molds which were 11 in. in diameter and 19.44 in. long. The  final product was copper logs that were approximately 22.6 in. in length and  11 in. in diameter. The explosion involving the casting of the molten copper  process occurred in the East Casting Machine in Mold Number 6. The blast  forced the pivoted point of the launder upward and discharged most of the  copper from the mold. Prior to the explosion  the three employees were having  problems maintaining the proper flow rate into Mold Number 6 because of the  spout became clogged with debris. One of the employees used a lance rod to  clear the spout. While attempting to clear the spout and regulate the molten  copper flow into the mold  the explosion occurred and sprayed molten metal  upon the workers. They all received severe burns and were hospitalized. In the  hospital  they were treated for multiple burns located on various body  regions. From the inspection of the Casting Machine  the copper shell in the  Mold Number 6 after the explosion had become lodged within the mold and  separated from the mold cup. As for the log  it did not travel downwards with  the mold cup but left a space between the log and the mold cup. The creation  of a space between these two articles is likely due to water or condensation  being introduced into the mold cup. As the molten copper or formed copper log  contacted the moisture in the space  the heat caused the liquid to vaporize  causing a rapid expansion of super-heated steam. This steam forced its way  through a weak spot in the shell bottom and propelled the molten metal from  the mold.,molten metal  casting  pit  burn  metal ingot  forming machine,3 304038193   Hospitalized injury Burn/Scald(Heat) Occupation not reported,,,,
202449427,Employee Injures Back In Fall From Scaffold,"At 7:00 a.m. on June 9  2008  Employee #1  a finishing employee  fell from an  Aluma-system  ""Safway"" tower scaffold. Employee #1 had worked as a cement  mason/finisher for 5 months. The employer is in the business of heavy  construction of highways and water treatment plants. Two crews (finishing and  stripping crews) were working in Cell #4  located in contactor building ""B"" of  the water treatment plant. A stripping crew was working in Cell #4A while at  the same time a finishing crew was working in the adjoining Cell #4B. Between  them was a baffle wall having three windows (openings) at a height of about 30  feet above the concrete floor. Employee #1 of the finishing crew went up a  24-foot high tower scaffold platform and received some tools in a bucket via a  rope. As Employee #1 was getting ready to receive some more material  he was  struck by a super stud (metal beam) which landed on the middle opening when a  stripping crew employee in cell #4A knocked the metal beam to remove the  wooden forms from the ceiling. Employee #1 fell 24 feet down (through a gap  between the top railing and the platform) to the floor  sustaining serious  injuries of his lower back and a fracture of his right foot.

202504429,Three Employees Burned In Plant Fire,At approximately 12:55 p.m. on June 12  2007  Employee's #1  #2  and #3 were  working on the first floor in the bagging area of a mill. Two roll ball  machines  used to screen cork into the desired product size  were located on  the third floor. These machines are mounted on a slight incline and shake to  facilitate the movement of cork through the screens. Each roll ball is  equipped with two sets of plates  one set on each side of the lower end of the  machine. These plates constantly slide against each other as the roll ball  moves back and forth. Over-sized cork drops out of the roll ball at the lower  end and falls into a hole in the floor between the two sets of plates. This  cork is transported by a suction system back to the mill on the first floor to  be ground again and reintroduced into the system. It is vital that the plates  on the roll balls are properly lubricated to help minimize the amount of heat  produced due to friction. One set of plates was completely dry and it is  believed that the plate generated enough heat to ignite the cork particulate  which tends to build up around the base of the roll ball screener. This  smoldering or burning cork was dropped into the system through the center  opening which suctions the plus back to the mill. The cork particles ignited  and a fire spread rapidly throughout the entire system. The fire blew out into  the bagging area where Employee's #1  #2  and #3 were working. The fire spread  to the bag house where it ignited approximately 240 cloth bags. Employee #1  sustained burns to his hands and face  some of which were third degree burns  and was hospitalized. Employee #2 was treated for first and second degree  burns to his right arm  ear and neck. He was released from the hospital the  same day and returned to work the following day.

202508446,Worker Sustains Fractures When Struck By Industrial Truck,At approximately 10:30 p.m. on February 3  2011  Employee #1 was working for  Del Monte Foods in Plant #1 at a worksite. The employer canned fruits and  vegetables. At least three other coworkers were at the worksite with her as  well. At the time of the accident  Employee #1 was assisting a mechanic by  turning off a switch located at the plant's Palletizer #5. The palletizer was  an Alvey Model Number 880 full-case palletizer. Employee #1 stepped out  backward (toward the west) from Palletizer #5 and looked up onto Palletizer  #5's elevated platform where the mechanic was to ask the mechanic if there was  anything else he needed her to do. As Employee #1 looked up  she felt  something hit her right buttock and push her forward. She turned around  saw a  forklift  and yelled. The forklift was the plant's forklift #93. It was  manufactured by Yale and had serial number A976B01646H. The maximum weight it  could carry was 12 080 lbs. (5 479 kilograms). The forklift operator was  driving eastbound in reverse while looking over his right shoulder and had not  seen Employee #1.

14215743,27 Employees Overexposed To Perchloroethylene Fumes,On April 12  1988  the drycleaners in a plant that manufactures hi-tech  sweaters from synthetic and cotton yarns were used for the first time with  perchloroethylene. The cotton sweaters are water washed and the synthetic  sweaters are drycleaned; the Donini washing/drycleaning machines are single  units with both capabilities. Although the plant had been in operation since  January 1988  and the washing/drycleaning machines had been in place since  February 1988  the actual drycleaning operation was not run until April 11   1988. On April 12  1988  a Donini technician was on site to insure proper  functioning of the machines. Some of the employees noticed a strong odor from  the drycleaners and some experienced headaches. On April 13  the employees  noticed the same odor and symptoms. One employee fainted due to a heart  condition. On April 14  the drycleaners were started at 7:30 a.m. By 7:45 a.m.  the odor was very strong in various parts of the finishing room. At 8:15 a.m.   the doors in the room were opened  which helped control the odor. At 10:00  a.m.  numerous employees started experiencing nausea  headaches  vomiting   breathing problems  fainting  muscle weakness  and eye and throat irritation.  At approximately 1:00 p.m.  the plant was evacuated due to employees  experiencing fainting and severe reactions. Employee #3 was vomiting blood and  was transported to the hospital. EMTs transported 40 to 50 employees to the  hospital. Employees #1 through #27 were hospitalized and treated for  inhalation of perchloroethylene. Employee #10 was placed in intensive care due  to a pre-existing condition. The Donini units have their own solvents recovery  unit with charcoal absorbent; are exhausted through a recovery system; and  have numeric controls. The machines are located in a 54 289 square ft room  with 14 ft ceilings. This same room contains sewing operations  steaming   inspection  and packaging; 75 employees work on each shift. There are three  HVAC units in the room  all with return air vents on the same side of the room  as the drycleaning units. No fresh air is brought in; all air is 100 percent  recycled through the HVAC systems. The incident was caused by poor design of  the finishing room; placement of the HVAC; and lack of makeup air. The  building is less than one year old and is very tight.

Employees #5 through #8 were in the carpenter shop lunchroom in the bleach plant on break. Sulfur dioxide escaped from the dump chest off gas controlling system, and all eight employees required hospitalization. The cause of the release from the sulfur dioxide controlling (recovery) system was that a valve on the #1 digester malfunctioned and remained open, letting fresh liquor flow into the dump chest. This was confirmed by the cook who saw that the valve light on his control panel was off, indicating a closed valve. The off light resulted because of the jammed dump valve, which is electrically driven and subject to being overloaded under the above condition. The #1 digester blow valve stem jammed because a journeyman pipefitter had accidentally removed its stem guide several days earlier. He and a newly hired pipefitter were supposed to have removed the blow valve stem guide from the #4, not the #1, digester. The #4 digester was down and locked out for repairs.

201521234,Burn,An electrical contractor dispatched an electrician and an apprentice to a town  center mall to repair a defective 200-ampere fusible disconnect in a  low-voltage main distribution switchboard. In preparation  the employees  deenergized a 200-ampere electric power and lighting panelboard located on the  second level of the mall. The panelboard was fed by the defective disconnect   which had an open pole. Next  the electrician (Employee #1) opened the  disconnect switch  disconnected the load-side 3/0 AWG conductors  and  reconnected then to a 400-ampere disconnect in an adjacent section of the  switchgear. The electrician discovered that the A-phase internal bus hardware  of the defective 200-ampere switch  including the fuse holder  was discolored  from long-term overheating. This was similar to a problem he had encountered  less than a month ago at another 200-ampered fusible disconnect within the  same low-voltage switchboard. The problem with that disconnect  which was  directly above the disconnect on which he was working that day  was also on  the A-phase. Upon completion of these tasks  the electrician closed only the  400-ampere disconnect and called his employer to explain what he had found.  The employer (Employee #3) and the mechanical superintendent of the mall  (Employee #2) met the electrician at the switchboard. After explaining to them  his findings and making a recommendation to replace the defective switches or  to consider upgrading the entire service entrance switchgear  the electrician  closed the door to the switch he had deactivated that day. As he was closing  the door of the other defective switch  an electrical fault occurred. The  ensuing electric arc burned the two employees and the employer and knocked  them to the floor.

14202345,Concrete Floor Slab Collapse While Being Removed From Below,On March 13  1987  three employees were cutting and removing a section of  concrete slab flooring in a paper mill. The section being removed was  approximately 30 ft by 10 ft with a thickness of 8 inches. Due to the paper  machine being located on the floor and being kept in operation during this  process  the work being done by the three employees was being done from below  or under the floor being removed. The employees were cutting  coring and  removing this 30 ft by 10 ft section in approximately 6 ft by 4 ft sections.  Ten of these sections had been successfully removed prior to the accident.  During the removal of the last two sections  an unplanned collapse occurred  resulting in approximately a 6 ft by 10 ft section of floor slab falling and  striking the three employees working below it.

Employee #1 was cooking a batch of  Natural Lemon (""WONF 858452"") in Durarome Reactor #3  in the Redline Cook  Department. According to Employee #1  Employee #3  a maintenance mechanic   informed Employee #2 but not him about a lockout/tagout procedure that would  take place and affect the cooking done by Employees #1 and #2 at Reactor #3.  In addition  the employer did not complete a required lockout/tagout permit.  Employee #1 indicated that he was cooking with the drop legs open  so that any  pressure build up would be relieved through the drop legs and back to the  upstream mixer. However  Employee #3 was working on compressed air lines that  powered all reactor steam and vent valves  including those that led to the  reactor vent line and would have normally allowed pressure created by the  heated sugar to escape safely to an upstream mixer. Employee #1 knew that the  initial line pressure of 70 psi to 80 psi had dropped to 1 psi to 20 psi.  However  he was at the end of the cooking process  and it was time to add oil  to the batch. Employee #1 turned off Reactor #2  including the shear blades  and steam  at the switch board. Employee #1 unscrewed the vent pipe  which was  shaped like a candy cane and apparently transported pressurized product safely  from Reactor #2 to the floor. Employee #1 said that anytime he anticipated  pressure build up  he would first open the port valve  but since he had not  anticipated pressure  he first loosened the candy cane-shaped vent pipe.  Because the valves were closed  the pressure could only be released through  the port of Reactor #2. The pressurized product contacted the back of Employee  #1's right hand and caused a third degree burn. Employee #1 was hospitalized  for more than 24 hours and he underwent two skin graft surgeries. The employer  reported the serious incident to the division on November 3  2009.",burn  hand  high pressure  high temperature  heat  lockout  pressure release  valve  venting,,,,,
