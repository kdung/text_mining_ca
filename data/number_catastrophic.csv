200535078,Three Employees Were Burned In Flash Arc Fire,"At approximately 9:00 a.m. on June 6  2012  Employee #1 an electrical  engineer  Employee #2 and Employee #3 electricians worked for the Gerdau  Ameristeel  Wilton  IA.  and for Davenport Electric Contract Company to  provide electrical maintenance in the Shredder area. A Fluke meter  rated for  a maximum of 1000 volts  was applied to a live circuit  energized at 4160  volts. Employee #2 replaced broken conduit which was used to bring power to  the 3000 hp Shredder Motor. Employee #3 was called to assist Employee #2. Two  extra cables were found in a Shredder junction box and Employee #1 asked  Employee's #2 and #3 to trace the cables. Single line prints were analyzed and  a connection to a capacitor was noted. Employee #1 reported that he did not  notice there were two different capacitors on the drawing. One capacitor was  south of the shredder building  installed for voltage stabilization and was  not labeled. The other capacitor  located in the Shredder Area electrical  substation  north of the Shredder building  was for power correction and was  labeled ""CAPACITOR BANK"". The Shredder was locked out at the substation. The  breaker  in the substation panel marked ""CAPACITOR BANK""  was open and the  panel door was initially locked out to prepare for testing. Employee #2 called  Employee #1 to ask if the ""CAPACITOR BANK"" breaker could be closed because the  initial continuity test did not work. Employee #1 entered the substation  enclosure to discuss the work with Employee #2 and Employee #3. Employee #1  agreed that it would be safe to close the breaker. The interlock  on the  substation cabinet door marked ""CAPACITOR BANK""  was defeated so the door  could remain open when the breaker was closed. The handle was in the ""on""  position. Employee #2 used a Fluke meter  rated for a maximum of 1000 volts   to try to test for ohms to confirm circuit continuity. The upstream lockout  acted upon the power stabilization capacitor bank  and was not upstream of the  ""CAPACITOR BANK"" power correction capacitor  the meter was applied to a live  circuit  energized at 4160 volts. A fault occurred and caused an arc flash.  Employee #1 reported he heard a buzz and then felt the flash. He saw that  Employee #2 was on fire. Employee #1 attempted to extinguish Employee #2's  clothing by rolling Employee #2 on the ground while yelling for help. Employee  #4 heard a pop and saw smoke rise from the substation area and alerted the  plant Emergency Response Team (ERT). Shredder Department Employees  who were  ERT members  responded immediately with an AED  fire extinguisher and a  medical equipment bag. Employee #2 was extinguished with a fire extinguisher.  A polyester blanket was placed over Employee #2 to cover and prevent shock.  Then the blanket caught on fire. The blanket was pulled away and a fire  extinguisher was used a second time to extinguish Employee #2's clothes. One  responder reported that a fire appeared to be coming from under Employee #2   so they rolled him and patted the fire down. First aid was provided. Employee  #1 reported he was approximately 8 to 10 feet away from the arc flash origin.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) worn at the time of the incident included  safety glasses  a 100 polyester high visibility safety vest  denim blue jeans   hard hat w/chin strap  steel toed work boots and a long sleeve flame resistant  (ATPV 7.7 rated) shirt. Employee #1 was burned on his hands while trying to  extinguish Employee #2. Employee #1 had flash burns to his face  with blisters  in some areas. Employee #1 was taken by ambulance and kept overnight in the  hospital. Employee #2 was not as seriously burned on his head and neck as he  was on the lower portions of his body. Employee #2's pants were consumed in  the fire  except for part of the waistband and approximately 6 inches of the  bottom of the pant legs. Employee #2 was flown via medical helicopter to a  hospital burn unit  where he was admitted with 55 percent of his body b",electric arc  electric conductor  electric meter  power line worker  elec protect equip  electrical box  capacitor  fire  buried,3 316574011   Hospitalized injury Burn/Scald(Heat) Electricians,"engineer employee,electricians",,,"engineer employee,electricians"
202082145,Six Employees Suffers From Chlorine Gas Poisoning,On July 5  2013  Employee #1  a shear operator  received for processing a  tanker with unknown contents at the scrap yard. The employee was using a large  shear to cut the tanker into small metal pieces. Employee #1 cut through the  outer layer and began to cut the inner steel layer; thereby  releasing an  unknown gas into the atmosphere. A gas cloud formed  and Employee #1 and 5  other employees immediately began experiencing adverse health effects that  included symptoms such as shortness of breath  chest tightness  and dizziness.  An evacuation occurred  and Employee #1  5 employees and three customers were  taken by Emergency Medical Services to the hospital for treatment. It was  determined that it was chlorine gas. The release occurred because the tanker  was not purged and pressurized. The employees' remained hospitalized.,sheared  shearing machine  tank  chlorine  gas  poisoning  inhalation  chest  dizziness,3 317173706   Non Hospitalized injury Other Laborers  except construction,shear operator,,,shear operator

170562383,Five Employees Suffer Minor Exposure To Strong Acid Vapors,Employee #1  a material handler at Ashland Chemical  was unloading two  55-gallon drums of hydrofluoric acid from a truck to temporary storage in a  warehouse  a distance of 50 to 100 feet  using a forklift with an attachment  designed for transporting two drums. The warehouse is several hundred yards  from the main facility. One half of the drum transporter released a drum   which fell approximately 18 inches to the ground. The inner poly liner  fractured  releasing hydrofluoric acid vapors through the outer steel drum.  Employee #1 vacated the immediate area and went to the warehouse  where he  informed a second material handler  Employee #2  of the event. Employee #2  radioed to the supervisor  Employee #5  who was working in the main facility.  Employees #5 and Employees #3 and #4 (material handlers) all heard the radio  call and proceeded to the warehouse. Once there  they established the  seriousness of the spill  set a perimeter  and called for an outside emergency  response team. Employees #1  #2  #3  #4  and #5 were taken to a nearby  hospital as a precautionary measure.,hydrofluoric acid  spill  drum  drum hoist,3 124617853   Non Hospitalized injury Burn(Chemical) Supervisors  material moving equipment operators,material handler,,,material handler
200351435,Five Employees Sent To Hospital After Ammonia Leak,At approximately 9:30 p.m. on or about July 31  Employee #1  a maintenance  technician for a can and bottling operation  responded to a possible ammonia  leak during the second shift at the plant. A 2 000 lb outside storage tank  pumped ammonia into the line-filled room to cool the syrups to between 35 and  40 degrees F before the cans and bottles were filled. Apparently  part of the  Hanson valve  which controlled the line flow  broke and ammonia had leaked  into the air. Employee #1 arrived and entered the maintenance room without any  respiratory PPE. Once the supervisor was present  however  all the maintenance  technicians donned respirators and were able to isolate the line where the  leak occurred. The plant was evacuated and the lead maintenance technician and  the second shift supervisor toured the facility with ammonia strips to  determine whether it was safe to re-enter. Ammonia was detected throughout the  plant  so the second shift employees were sent home and all the doors were  opened to allow the buildings to air out. Employee #1 said he felt nauseous  and had a headache  and the supervisor sent him to the Emergency Room. After  determining the plant was safe to enter  the supervisor and maintenance lead  decided to allow the third shift to begin work. Shortly thereafter  several  employees in different parts of the building began to experience burning  sensations on their faces and in their noses and respiratory tract. Even after  stepping outside  these employees did not feel better  so the supervisor sent  them to the hospital as a precaution. The supervisor and maintenance lead then  called the plant manager and requested permission to send the third shift  home. Employee #1 and coworkers were treated and released  although Employee  #1 was instructed by the doctor to take one day off from work. The location of  the ammonia leak was in the compressor room  not the filler room  where there  was a control panel that would shut down the system if a drop in pressure was  detected  as happened in this case. Preventive maintenance was performed on  the regulator valves  but not on the gaskets. In this case  the failure  occurred due to a pinhole in a gasket. According to the lead maintenance  technician  there was no way to prevent the occurrence. Because the  refrigeration system was a closed loop  the tank had never been refilled in  the 3 years the plant has been in operation. It was later determined that  between 50 and 75 lb of hot vapor had been released.,ammonia  leak  air contamination  vapor  accidental discharge  respiratory tract  inhalation  chemical vapor  gasket,,maintenance technician,,,maintenance technician

202079570,Eight Employees Are Exposed To Chemical Vapor Release,Eight employees were exposed to a chemical vapors released after a metal shear  cut into an old acetylene cylinder at a metal recycling scrap yard. Employee  #1 was using a grapple attachment on a mobile crane to pick up and separate  scrap metal longer than three feet so that Employee #2 could then use a  hydraulic metal shear attached to the end of an excavator to shear the longer  pieces into pieces of three feet or less. Employee #1 separated out three  compressed gas cylinders which Employee #2 proceeded to shear into shorter  pieces. As Employee #2 was shearing one cylinder  it released a vapor into the  air. Breathing the substance (probably a mixture of acetylene and acetone)  resulted in some upper respiratory irritation as well as burning and watery  eyes. Eight workers were decontaminated by the hazmat team and were  transported to the local hospital where they were evaluated  treated  and  released.

200998474,Five Employees Are Over Exposed To Carbon Monoxide,On November 11  2010  five employees of Gibson County Area Rehabilitation  Centers  Incorporated  were working in or near the Industrial Services Area on  a forklift. The combination of operating an improperly maintained forklift   inside an area with little to no air ventilation  caused all the employees to  be exposed to vast concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO). Two of the five  employees lost consciousness while working in the Industrial Services Area.  All of the employees were transported to Gibson General Hospital  where blood  draws were taken to determine each employee's blood gas levels  including the  percentage of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) present in each employee's blood. It  was determined that the employees had COHb levels  ranging between 6.1 and  23.3. All five of these employees were diagnosed with CO toxicity/poisoning.

201792710,Three Employees Fall Unconcious,"On September 26  1999  Employee #1  Employee #2  and Employee #3 were  participating in a training drill. All three employees were assigned to the  decontamination team  which is responsible for decontaminating hazardous  materials response members. The team was suited in level B protective gear and  was utilizing Self Contained Breathing Apparatus. The team was using a ""buddy  breather"" system  which allowed the team to switch from breathing air from a  cylinder to an airline drawing air from Air Utility-21 air tanks. The Air  Utility-21 airline system consisted of 300 ft of Synflex hose (an internal  part of system)  a manifold  and three separate 75-ft portable Gates Premoflex  airline hoses. The manifold was capable of splitting the compressor's airlines  into five 50-ft lines; however for the purpose of this drill  three 75-ft  lines were used. Employee #1 was the first of the three team members to switch  to breathing air from the Air Utility-21 airline. Employees #2 and #3 switched  onto the airline a few seconds later. Employee #1 reported that after  approximately 10 seconds  he began to feel dizzy. Employee #1 stopped and bent  over to rest and informed Employees #2 and #3 to suit-up. Employee #1 recalls  walking away from Employee #2 and #3  stumbling and tripping. Employee #1 then  fell  face-forward  onto the floor  but does not remember this. The impact of  Employee #1's fall resulted in a laceration to his nose and forehead caused by  the impact of his face hitting his respirator face piece. This injury required  stitches. The next thing Employee #1 remembered was being aware of firemen  picking him up and providing him with first aid. Employee #2 connected to the  airline after Employee #1. Employee #2 recalls that after approximately two  breaths  he began to feel dizzy and thought that he may have stood up to  quickly which he reasoned was the cause of his dizziness. After a dozen more  breaths  Employee #2 felt lightheaded  nauseated  dizzy  and had hazy vision.  Employee #2 then looked towards Employees #1 and #3 to see what they were  doing and disconnected himself from the airline. Employee #2 took a few steps  towards Employee #3 and yelled at him to ""go off air."" Employee #2 then  realized Employee #1 was down on the floor. Employee #3 switched over to  breathe air off of the airline shortly after Employee #2. After one or two  breaths  Employee #3 recalls having difficulty with his manual dexterity   having a hard time attaching a hook that holds his breathing apparatus  and  felt that he had tunnel vision. After approximately 10 seconds of breathing  air from the airline  Employee #2 yelled at him to disconnect himself from the  airline. Employee #3 disconnected from the airline  estimating that he had  breathed air from the line for no more than 15 seconds. At this time  he  noticed that Employee #1 was on the ground. Paramedics were present at the  drill and took the vitals of all three team members and placed them on oxygen  for 20 minutes.

202079026,Four Employees Are Intoxicated By Leaking Argon,At approximately 5:40 pm. on October 17  2007  a wiring employee came to a  press brake to get more pieces from Employee #1  a press operator. Employee #1  turned and put down a piece  collapsed to the floor  and experienced  convulsions. The wiring employee panicked and asked the laser operator for  help. The laser operator cleared the area. As he stood from the kneeled  position  he also became lightheaded and lost consciousness momentarily. All  employees were then evacuated by the shift supervisor per their emergency  action plan. It occurred that six argon tanks were being stored on the inside  wall of the 47 000 square ft building  approximately 55 ft from the press  brake department  with one tank supplying the building's system line for  welding operations throughout the facility. Two other employees in the  immediate area of the argon tanks also experienced lightheadedness and were  transported to the hospital with the aforementioned as a precautionary  measure. The Technical Sales representative from National Welders responded to  the scene and tested for oxygen deficiency. He tested the system line at 100  psi  which revealed no leaks and suggested that the tank connected to the  supply line released gas from the relief valve due to back pressure from the  line. The Manufacturing Engineer confirmed that two tanks were found leaking.  One of the tanks was completely emptied over the span of a week  while the  other was still leaking three weeks from the incident. Each tank has the  capacity to hold 471 lbs of liquid argon. Fire Department and Emergency  Medical Service cleared the scene for resumption of occupancy after finding no  oxygen deficiency present. The company removed all tanks with argon  immediately after the incident. Four tanks were placed along the outside wall  and two leaky tanks were put approximately 70 yards from the building. The  company reconnected the tank to the supply line by drilling through the wall.  They also ordered oxygen sensors to be placed throughout the facility and  connected them to the company's alarm system.,press brake  press operator  fall  tank  argon  leak  intoxicated,,,,,
200120640,Ten Employees Injured By Carbon Monoxide Exposure,Employees #1 through #10 were engaged in asbestos abatement work at a Sears  retail store in a shopping mall. They were inside a 6 000 square foot  containment with 14 foot ceilings  using a propane-powered floor scraper to  remove the two layers of flooring and most of the mastic from the concrete  subfloor.

The breaker failed and they decided to replace it. Employee #2 and #3 removed the cover and exposed energized parts of the 600 amp breaker. There was a 900 amp breaker at the bottom of the switchboard marked with Emergency Service Disconnect above the breaker and Panel DEQH Equipment Branch below the breaker, which made the electricians think the breaker would turn off the power to the switchboard. Employee #2 turned off the 900 amp breaker and tested the 600 amp breaker with a voltmeter to confirm it was deenergized, but found it was still energized. They decided to remove the 900 amp breaker cover to determine why it was still energized. Employee #2 and #3 were on their knees on either side of the switchboard. While kneeling by the switchboard, they removed the cover above the 900 amp breaker when an electrical arc was produced. The electric arc struck Employee #2 and threw him to the floor, causing him head contusions. Employee #1 received minor burns to his abdomen. Employee #3 received second and third degree burns to his face, neck and forearms outside his cotton t-shirt. The switchboard arced, burned, and smoked until the power was shut off.

200376507,Four Workers Sustain Cuts When Glass Meter Shatters,On or about June 21  2013  Employees #1  #2  and #3  electrical power  installers  plus Employee #4  who was the work crew superintendent  plus  Coworkers #1  #2  and #3  all of Utec Constructors Corporation  were  installing insulation to electrical power transmission lines. The lines were  in eight conduits along a road. Nitrogen was being used for the insulation. An  18-wheel trailer contained 10 tubes of nitrogen  with a total volume of  approximately 100 000 cubic feet. Four of the workers were standing on or  around the back of the trailer  and the superintendent was standing along the  left side of the trailer. Two workers were in a manhole and operating valves  where a hose attached to the manifold on the back of the trailer. The  superintendent instructed the crew to open the valves. He then noticed that  the valve on the manifold in line behind the nitrogen flow meter was leaking.  He said to close the valve  meaning to close the valve on the nitrogen tube.  Instead  the valve on the conduit in the manhole was closed. Closing this  valve caused a buildup of pressure. As a result of this pressure  the glass  portion of the flow meter failed and shattered. When the glass shattered   Employees #1  #2  #3  and #4 were struck by flying glass. They were  transported to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC Health).  Employees #1  #2  and #4 were treated for cuts and bruises to the face  and  Employee #3 was treated for cuts to the left wrist. Employee #1 was admitted  for an overnight stay. Employees #2  #3  and #4 were released without  hospitalization. At the time of this report  all the injured employees were  continuing to recover. The subsequent investigation determined that the  nitrogen flow meter was manufactured by SK Micrometer. The investigator was  unable to verify the model number  which had been on the glass that shattered.  All employees were wearing appropriate PPE  including hard hats  safety  glasses  and work boots. The two employees in the manhole were also wearing  harnesses and lanyards.

201146065,Four Employees Are Injured In Ethylene Oxide Explosion,"At approximately 2:50 p.m. on August 19  2004  Employees #1  #2  #3  and #4  were working in a scrubber processing unit at Sterigenics in Ontario  CA.  Sterigenics utilizes ethylene oxide to sterilize medical equipment. Employees  #2  #3  and #4 were performing normal scrubber operation duties  and Employee  #1 was working in a supervisory capacity in the mezzanine control room.  Chamber number 7 of the scrubber indicated that it had not received an  ethylene oxide injection during a validation cycle. Maintenance employees were  summoned to troubleshoot the error. After performing various checks on the  chamber and system  the maintenance technician and maintenance supervisor  calibrated its SEC IR spectrometer to verify the operation of the  sterilization number 7 step. This procedure checks the ethylene oxide  injection into the sterilization chambers and comprises of several  verification phases. The gas inject phase involves the injection of  approximately 125 lb of ethylene oxide into the chamber  which is followed by  a gas dwell phase. In the vacuum phase  approximately 50 lb of the gas is  evacuated from the room to a scrubber  and then the scrubber goes into a  vacuum hold phase. The vacuum phase checks the ability of the chamber to  maintain vacuum condition. It involves the injection of three gases  including  nitrogen and or steam to remove the ethylene oxide from the sterilization  chamber  and then the final release  in which a minimal amount of residual  ethylene oxide is flushed using air. The residual ethylene oxide and air  mixture is sent to a fired catalytic oxidizer that react the residual ethylene  oxide to neutralize it. Employee #5 verified that the gas dwell phase and  vacuum phase ran correctly and requested the permissive password for  authorization to advance the procedure cycles to final release. Employee #5  received the permissive password from Employee #6 and advanced the cycles   bypassing the gas or ""safety"" washes. Employee #5 then proceeded to open the  chamber door on chamber number 7. Opening the chamber door causes a blower to  send air through the chamber and blow any residual gases to the fired  catalytic oxidizer. A high concentration of approximately 62 lb of ethylene  oxide was routed from the sterilization chamber number 7 to the fired  catalytic oxidizer  resulting in an explosion and extensive structural and  equipment damage. The explosion caused injuries to the employees located near  by the scrubber processing unit. Some of the employees received injuries that  included contusions and lacerations from flying glass and debris as a result  of the explosion.",maintenance  cleaning  laceration  flammable vapors  ethylene oxide  gas leak  explosion,3 305354615   Non Hospitalized injury Cut/Laceration Occupation not reported,,,,

200376481,Three Employees Suffer Burns When Sprayed By Hot Water,At approximately 8:00 a.m. on August 15  2013  Employees #1 and #4 were  setting up two vessels  diaphragm pumps  and hoses to perform a test water  heating procedure in the pilot plant area at Pulcra Chemicals  LLC. No  chemicals were used during the testing. This was not the employee's usual job  task. The vessels that were being used were a 100 gallon atmospheric mixing  vessel and a 350 gallon International bulk container (IBC) tote. The set-up  was conducted to test the heating of water in the 100 gallon mixing vessel to  approximately 80 degree Celsius and 176 degrees Fahrenheit by using steam  heated water from the IBC tote and circulating it through the jacket on the  100 gallon vessel using pumps. On the lid there was a 3 in. metal filling cap  that housed a 5:1 vent pressure relief valve that was set to activate at 5 lbs  per square inch of pressure. There was not a pressure gauge on the IBC tote  and it contained decals that stated Caution do not pressurize this tank. This  unit had a temperature gauge on it. At approximately 9:00 a.m.  Employee #1  filled the IBC tote with approximately 250 to 275 gallons of water. The tote  did not contain a fill gauge and the employee filled the unit so that it would  not have to be refilled for the duration of the heating process. The employee  began the heating procedure. The water in the 100 gallon vessel began to heat  up when the temperature gauge read 30 to 40 degrees Celsius and 86 to 104  degrees Fahrenheit. At this time  Employee #1 alerted Employees #2 and #3 that  the process was underway.

The employees walked over to the laboratory area of the Pulcra  Chemicals plant that was approximately 600 ft from the pilot plant area. The  temperature of the 100 gallon mixing tank was at 74 to 76 degrees Celsius  and166 to169 degrees Fahrenheit. The employees were standing 8 to 10 ft from  the front of the IBC tote. Over pressurization caused the lid of the IBC tote  to open its seal and hot water went into the air and sprayed down on Employees  #1  #2  and #3. The employees were able to turn away prior to being burned by  the water. Employee #1 suffered first and second degree burns on his back.

Employee #1 was placing the empty cylinders on a Plant Systems  Incorporated (PSI) carousel and connecting the fill hose to each cylinder. The  carousel then rotated the cylinders clockwise around the servicing area  approximately 270 degrees  at which point Employee #2 would disconnect the  filled tank and place it on a conveyor next to the carousel. Employee #3 would  take the cylinders from the conveyor and place them on wooden pallets for  shrink-wrapping and shipping. Employee #1 was preparing to fill an empty  cylinder by connecting the fill hose and opening the cylinder's fill valve. He  was reaching to press the FILL button on the control panel of the carousel  when a flash fire occurred. Employees #1 and #2 sustained first- and  second-degree burns to their faces and were admitted to Baptist Hospital Burn  Center in Winston-Salem  NC. Employee #3 suffered minor facial burns and  singed hair; he was treated and released. During subsequent investigation  it  was determined that the company did not have any dress requirements  nor did  any governing standard establish what employees should or should not wear  while working at or near the carousel. Employee #1 was wearing all-cotton  clothing with the exception of an overshirt that he was using as a jacket. The  overshirt was composed of a 100 percent cotton shell  a 100 percent nylon  lining  and a 100 percent polyester fiber filling. The synthetic materials  used in the lining and filling were static producing materials and could have  caused or increased the risk of sparks from static electricity. Further  investigation revealed that there was no requirement to ground/bond the  propane cylinders or the fill guns used to fill the cylinders.

Employee #1 suffered severe second-and-third-degree burns to 20 percent of his  body. Employees #2 and #3 suffered similar injuries over a smaller percent of  their body. The accident occurred at a customer's premises  during working  hours. The fire caused significant damage to the bathroom  detaching a locked  door and separating it from the door frame. The three employees were wearing  half-mask respirators with an inappropriate cartridge  short-sleeve shirts   latex exam gloves and the only source of ventilation was from a ceiling fan  rated at 6 to 9 air changes per hour. The employer had no safety plan for  performing the floor stripping operation and did not bring portable  ventilation to the site.

The 120-volt  oven  operating at 220 to 230 degrees Fahrenheit  was located outside Building  #809. At 7:30 a.m.  employees within the building noticed a strange odor and  called the safety office. At 8:06 a.m.  the safety office determined that the  oven was the source of the odor. Fumes had apparently been drawn into the main  assembly and receiving inspection rooms while the oven was unattended. The  oven door was opened and a flash or flame occurred; the oven was then  unplugged and turned off. The building was evacuated at 8:30 a.m. after  several employees complained of respiratory  eye  and throat irritation. No  chlorine  hydrogen chloride  or phosgene could be detected in the oven at that  time. As a precautionary measure  35 employees (32 of the 165 main assembly  room workers and 3 of the 7 receiving inspection room workers) were  transported to the hospital for observation and evaluation. Based on their  symptoms or previous medical conditions  five employees were hospitalized for  observation.

202504429,Three Employees Burned In Plant Fire,At approximately 12:55 p.m. on June 12  2007  Employee's #1  #2  and #3 were  working on the first floor in the bagging area of a mill. Two roll ball  machines  used to screen cork into the desired product size  were located on  the third floor. These machines are mounted on a slight incline and shake to  facilitate the movement of cork through the screens. Each roll ball is  equipped with two sets of plates  one set on each side of the lower end of the  machine. These plates constantly slide against each other as the roll ball  moves back and forth. Over-sized cork drops out of the roll ball at the lower  end and falls into a hole in the floor between the two sets of plates. This  cork is transported by a suction system back to the mill on the first floor to  be ground again and reintroduced into the system. It is vital that the plates  on the roll balls are properly lubricated to help minimize the amount of heat  produced due to friction. One set of plates was completely dry and it is  believed that the plate generated enough heat to ignite the cork particulate  which tends to build up around the base of the roll ball screener. This  smoldering or burning cork was dropped into the system through the center  opening which suctions the plus back to the mill. The cork particles ignited  and a fire spread rapidly throughout the entire system. The fire blew out into  the bagging area where Employee's #1  #2  and #3 were working. The fire spread  to the bag house where it ignited approximately 240 cloth bags. Employee #1  sustained burns to his hands and face  some of which were third degree burns  and was hospitalized. Employee #2 was treated for first and second degree  burns to his right arm  ear and neck. He was released from the hospital the  same day and returned to work the following day.

101360774,Four Employees Injured In Flash Dust Fire,At approximately 6:07 p.m. on July 1  1998  Employees #1 through #4   maintenance workers for Baxter Healthcare  were working atop a suspended grid  ceiling in the injection molding department. Baxter Healthcare had hired  Hill's Welding Service and Crane Rental to raise the existing roof support  steel over a 68 ft by 24 ft section of the injection molding module to  accommodate newer and taller injection molding equipment. Hot welding slag  fell down from the top of an I-beam being installed onto an existing Armstrong  ceiling with tile composed of mineral wool fiber. The hot slag ignited dust  that had previously settled on top of the ceiling tile  resulting in a small  smoldering fire. Employee #1 climbed a 10 ft tall cinderblock wall and began  trying to snuff out the fire with his foot. Apparently either the smoldering  fire burned through the tile allowing dust particles to become airborne in a  combustible concentration  or his efforts disturbed the dust. The fire then  flashed in all directions  consuming the suspended dust particles. Employee #1  fell through the suspended grid ceiling  which disturbed more dust particles  and caused a more widespread flash dust fire. Employees #1 through #4 suffered  first-  second-  and third-degree burns and were taken by coworkers to the  local hospital.

200841690,Eight Employees Were Sickened By Paranitroaniline Exposure,At approximately 11:00 a.m. on August 30  2008  eight employees were working  at a warehouse facility  where chemicals were stored for customers  mixing  operations were conducted  and dry chemicals were repackaged. Five of the  employees were employed by the facility. Two of the employees were not  employed by the company or another contractor. The employment status of the  eighth employee was not stated. The employees were transferring a dry  paranitroaniline powder from 55-gallon drums to six-foot-tall supersacks that  could hold 3 000 pounds of material. Three forklifts were used to transfer the  paranitroaniline. One forklift  with a drum tilter attachment  was used to  lift the drum. Another forklift was used to raise a supersack acting as a  funnel. A third forklift held a second supersack that was placed below the  raised supersack  to catch the paranitroaniline dumped into the raised  supersack. Employees staged the drums and removed the lids. As the forklift  lifted the drum  an employee pulled the chain on the drum tilter  allowing the  material to fall into the funnel sack. All of the employees in the area shared  the different job tasks for the transfer of the paranitroaniline. Nine drums  were used to fill a supersack with 2 700 pounds of paranitroaniline. Because  of height clearance requirements  the transfer operation was being conducted  off of a loading dock  outside of the building. During transfer of the  material  one of the drums on the drum tilter fell into the funnel sack   creating a large dust cloud of paranitroaniline. The employees were not  properly protected from the skin and respiratory hazards of paranitroaniline.  Within hours of performing the transfer  all employees were becoming ill  and  they drove themselves to different hospitals in the St. Louis area.

310811666,Twenty One Employees Are Injured In Chemical Spill,On May 11  2007  an employee was changing out a pallet of drums in the  hazardous materials storage area which contained chemicals that feed the lines  to the industrial washing machines. The chemical normally used in the  industrial washing machines was sodium hypochlorite (12 in. solution  which  was stored in labeled blue drums in the hazardous materials storage area).  Also located in the hazardous materials storage area were drums containing  Sulfuric Acid  93 in. solution  stored in labeled black drums and utilized in  a separate area of the facility to lower the pH of wastewater prior to  discharge to the sanitary sewer system. When the drums of sodium hypochlorite  were empty  they were typically changed out with another pallet of drums.  According to witnesses  the sulfuric acid drums were moved into place to feed  the industrial wash lines instead of sodium hypochlorite  and the solution was  then used to launder garments on May 10. The garments laundered had a distinct  odor  and the mistake was noticed at about 6:00 p.m. on May 10. The employer  stopped laundering garments until the following morning. On the morning of May  11  the chemical supplier was contacted regarding the proper way to flush the  industrial wash lines and reintroduce the sodium hypochlorite to continue  laundry operations. The employee was in charge of changing out the pallet of  sulfuric acid drums  replacing them with sodium hypochlorite drums  and  restarting the laundry process using the methods described by the chemical  supplier. The chemical supplier advised the employee and managers to flush the  sulfuric acid out of the feed lines using water  and then reintroduce the  sodium hypochlorite solution. When the sodium hypochlorite was reintroduced to  the feed lines  it reacted with approximately one quart of residual sulfuric  acid which was still in the floor drain area near the industrial washing  machines and produced chlorine gas which was vented to the main wash room. The  chlorine gas was noticeable by the effect it had on nearby employees  who had  respiratory distress  problems with their eyes  and caused workers to feel  dizzy and nauseous. No alarms were sounded and the facility evacuation relied  on word of mouth communication between workers. The facility was evacuated;  however  some workers remained inside longer because they were uninformed of  the evacuation and of the nature of the chlorine gas inside the building. At  approximately 8:45 a.m.  emergency services were notified and responded to the  site. Twenty one employees were transported to local hospitals for evaluation  and treatment; however  all employees were released the same day.

Employees #5 through #8 were in the carpenter shop lunchroom in the bleach plant on break. Sulfur dioxide escaped from the dump chest off gas controlling system, and all eight employees required hospitalization. The cause of the release from the sulfur dioxide controlling (recovery) system was that a valve on the #1 digester malfunctioned and remained open, letting fresh liquor flow into the dump chest. This was confirmed by the cook who saw that the valve light on his control panel was off, indicating a closed valve. The off light resulted because of the jammed dump valve, which is electrically driven and subject to being overloaded under the above condition. The #1 digester blow valve stem jammed because a journeyman pipefitter had accidentally removed its stem guide several days earlier. He and a newly hired pipefitter were supposed to have removed the blow valve stem guide from the #4, not the #1, digester. The #4 digester was down and locked out for repairs.

The accident occurred during the first shift as  the pipe was being unloaded from a railcar. Per company policy  Employee #1  worked with two other employees. Employee #1's job was to set the brake on the  railcar; Employee #3 was the spotter  and Employee #2 was the forklift driver  and the railcar positioner and pusher (using the forklift to hold the railcars  in position). The usual procedure was : Employee #2 pushes the railcars with  the forklift; Employee #3 watched and relayed the signal of Employee #1  who  set the brake on the railcar. At the time of the accident  Employee #1  signaled Employee #3 and disappeared from view. Employee #3 signalled Employee  #2  who released the forks of the forklift holding the railcars. Employee #2  realized when he moved his forklift back  that the railcars came ""with him""   meaning that that the brakes had not been applied. Employee #1 sustained  serious injuries. The front of his leg was struck by the rungs of the ladder  he was attempting to climb and the back of his leg was struck by stacked  bundles of pipe that were placed on the ground  behind and close to the rail  flatcar. This resulted in an open fracture of his left leg. Several factors  contributed to the   1) No written procedures and safety training on  railcar positioning and unloading of railcars was done prior to the accident.  2) The railcars were not chocked or otherwise prevented from moving. 3) Pipe  bundles were permitted to remain on the ground adjacent to a track at a  distance less than 8 feet 6 inches from the center line of track. %09",railroad car  rail  struck by  leg  fracture  flatbed rail car  chock,,yard supervisor,,,yard supervisor
201075199,Employee Fractures Leg When Struck By Concrete,On March 29  2010  Employee #3  a leased-employee from Pirate Staffing  Company  and Employee #4 had raised a chunk of waste concrete 4 to 6 inches  thick several inches long out of a chute. A piece of chain was rigged around  the concrete chunk  and  it was hoisted onto an elevated platform above the  chute using a manual chain hoist. The concrete chunk was lowered to the deck  and rested on the platform and the inside toe board edge of the platform. As  it rested  slack developed in the chain around the concrete chunk  which  allowed it to shift position. As it shifted  it struck Employee #3 in the  front of his lower left leg. Employee #3 further stated that he was able to  walk with slight discomfort  which he associated with the raspberry mark on  his leg. Employee #3 noticed the potential problem with his leg  while sitting  in his recliner at home. He noticed some abnormal movement of the leg when the  leg was in an elevated position in the recliner. Employee #3 had his wife take  him to Kaiser Hospital  where he was hospitalized for a period of over 24  hours due to his leg fracture.

200800522,Inadvertant Mixing Of Cleaning Chemicals,On October 3  2001 Employee #1  a plant manager  explained that the three part  automated cleaning system of a cream yeast system failed to keep the chemicals  separated. It appears that a valve failed during the three part cleaning  system  allowing caustic acid and sanitizer to mix. The result of the mixture  created a chlorine gas exposure to a total of 31 employees who were sent to  the hospital. Employees #1  #2  and #3 remained overnight for further  evaluation. The employees had not been provided training on the chemicals they  were utilizing in the cleaning system nor were they trained on the evacuation  procedure in the event of a release. The company was utilizing new chemicals   which contained sodium hypochlorite  for approximately one month. The caustic  containing sodium hypochlorite was not recommended by the manufacturer of the  cleaning system.

14216568,Fire Fighters Injured In Separate Falls,At approximately 1:05 a.m. on February 26  1992  Employee #1  a fire fighter  of New Haven Truck Company #4  fell off a roof. According to other fire  fighters  visibility was zero due to heavy smoke and Employee #1 was walking  on the roof rather than crawling as he should have been. Employee #1 fell  approximately 25 ft into a blind alley between two buildings. He had to be  extricated into the alley window of the building on fire and brought out to  the street through the first floor. The rescue took 15 to 30 minutes before  Employee #1 was removed to EMS. He sustained serious closed head injuries. As  of March 12  1992  Employee #1 remained  unresponsive  on a ventilator.  Employee #2  a fire fighter from Engine #10  sustained a back contusion after  falling approximately 10 ft from a fire escape while trying to access the  second floor in order to contain the fire (this occurred prior to Employee  #1's rescue from the alley).

201186301,Foreman Is Burned When Fuel Ignites During Machine Refueling,At approximately 2:25 p.m. on June 25  2012  Employee #1  a Foreman for  Rainbow Waterproofing & Restoration Co.  was working at a 22-story building  site in San Francisco. The building was undergoing extensive exterior  restoration due to water damage  including removing the masonry facade and  cleaning the rusted steel beam using pneumatic hammers and needle guns. Two  gasoline powered air compressors (Rolair Systems with Honda engines  Model  #8422HK30) had been placed on the third floor roof of the building. Each  compressor had a 1.5-gallon gas tank and a 9-gallon air tank. In addition   each compressor had a 7.5-gallon auxiliary air tank. The compressors were  usually refueled twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  Gasoline was kept in a 5-gallon type-I flammable liquid can equipped with a  plastic funnel. The employer had recently purchased a different brand of  flammable liquid can (Justrite) whose attached funnel was designed so that it  could be bent and take less space during storage/transportation. That feature  made the funnel susceptible to leakage when pouring the liquid. Employee #1  was refueling one of the compressors. The employer's procedure for refueling  the air compressors  as well as other gas powered equipment  was to ensure the  engine was off. According to the employer's subsequent statement  as Employee  #1 refueled the compressor  the gasoline leaked from the two sides of the  attached funnel onto the hot muffler of the compressor and ignited. Coworkers  #1 and #2  who were on the swing stage  suddenly lost air pressure on their  needle guns and saw that the compressors were on fire. They grabbed their fire  extinguisher and assisted Employee #1 to extinguish the fire. The fire was  extinguished by the time the Fire Department arrived. Employee #1 was  transported to a hospital  where he was treated for a first degree burn on his  right forearm  burns to the face  and smoke inhalation. He was then released.  The cause of the accident was spilling of gasoline onto the hot muffler.  Cal/OSHA regulation T8 CCR 5451(e) requires employers to take precautions  against liquid spillage and sources of ignition when transferring flammable  and combustible liquid from one container into another. Although T8 CCR  5451(p) also requires bonding and grounding of containers during such  transfer  static electricity probably was not a major contributing factor in  this fire incident.,construction  refueling  smoke inhalation  gas can  leak  flammable liquid  fire  burn  arm  face,1 312693419   Non Hospitalized injury Burn/Scald(Heat) Occupation not reported FallDist: FallHt:Cause: WaterproofingFatCause: Fire/explosion,foreman,,,foreman
201129640,Painter Falls From Scaffold And Fractures Skull And Wrist,At approximately 9:45 a.m. on March 14  2013  Employee #1  a painter employed  by a painting contractor  was working from a rolling scaffold. He was part of  a small crew assigned to paint a commercial space in the basement of a  shopping mall. Employee #1 was alone on the scaffold and using a spray gun to  paint the ceiling and upper areas of the room. Employee #1 fell from the  scaffold platform to the floor  a distance of approximately 7 feet. The San  Mateo Fire Department responded to a call for assistance. Employee #1 was  transported to Stanford Hospital  where he was admitted and treated for a  fractured skull and fractured left wrist. This event was timely reported to  Cal/OSHA by the employer and the San Mateo Fire Department. The subsequent  investigation determined that Employee #1 was working with Coworker #1 to  paint the area. Coworker #2  the crew foreman  was supervising Employee #1 and  Coworker #1. Another worker  Coworker #3  only had assisted with the scaffold  set-up at the start of the shift. Employee #1 and Coworker #2 stated the  scaffold platform was set at 7 feet  and they did not have enough room to  install both 4-foot guardrail end-sections and X-bracing for rails because the  fluorescent light fixtures were 11 feet above the floor. Both said that all  four wheel brakes were applied at the time of the fall. Coworkers #1 and #2  said they did not see Employee #1 actually fall off the scaffold and that  Employee #1 was the only worker on the scaffold. Employee #1 said he cannot  recall the actual fall but thinks he may have lost his balance. Coworkers #1  and #2 said that no ladders  buckets  or other objects were being used to gain  greater working height at the time of the fall. All four employees who had  involvement at the site stated that there were no defects or problems with the  scaffold. The scaffold was set up and measured during Cal/OSHA's inspection of  the site  and the platform was less than 7 feet 6 inches above surface  so  guardrails were not required in this configuration  per Section 1646. No  precipitating action for the fall was definitively established. Employee #1  may have fallen as he was coming down off the scaffold  or as he lost balance  on the platform  or by accidentally stepping past the platform edge.  CITATIONS: No accident-related citations were issued as a result of the  investigation  as there were no causative violations identified. Citations  were issued for the following violations: 1-1 General T8CCR 3395(f)(3):  Failure to establish written procedures for Heat Illness Prevention for  outdoor workers; and 1-2 Regulatory T8CCR 1509(a) {ref: 3203(b)}: Failure to  maintain documentation of employee training.,construction  painter  scaffold  mobile scaffold  fall  fall protection  skull  wrist  fracture  guardrail,1 315775577   Hospitalized injury Fracture Painters  construction and maintenance FallDist: 7FallHt:7Cause: Interior painting and decoratingFatCause: Fall from/with scaffold,painter,,,painter

202588307,Worker Falls From Scaffold Ladder  Sustains Injuries,At approximately 1:45 p.m. on March 8  2013  Employee #1  an apprentice  employed by Farwest Insulation Contracting  was part of a crew installing  insulation to the ZLD Crystallizer Feed Tank on the Russell City Energy Center  Project construction site in Hayward  CA. Her employer had been subcontracted  by the general contractor  Bechtel. This work required working on scaffolding.  Employee #1 was working on the second deck of the scaffolding  above grade   and helping Coworker #1 install insulation. The foreman  Coworker #2  was  working on a level above Employee #1. Employee #1's immediate supervisor   Coworker #3  was working at another location on site and checking on Employee  #1 approximately every 20 minutes  as needed. There was a large crew that day   with frequent supervision. Employee #1 was summoned to come down to ground  level to assist. Upon exiting the gate at the scaffold rail  Employee #1  descended the ladder. At a level of approximately 8 feet above the ground   Employee #1 lost her footing and fell. She landed on her side  striking a  standoff-supported 6-inch diameter pipe. The Hayward Fire Department responded  to a call for emergency assistance and transported Employee #1 to the  hospital  where she was admitted and treated for fractured ribs  a punctured  right lung  and bruises to her right kidney and right leg. The Hayward Fire  Department reported this event to Cal/OSHA at 9:20 p.m. on March 8  2013   leaving a message with the Cal/OSHA Division's after-hours messaging service.  The employer also attempted to report the event to Cal/OSHA but inadvertently  called the local Federal OSHA office. A Cal/OSHA representative contacted the  employer on March 11  2013. The subsequent investigation found no obvious  causal factor. Employee #1 was not carrying anything while descending the  ladder  and the scaffolding and its ladder were observed to have been properly  erected by Bechtel. The investigator's report concluded that Employee #1's  injuries appeared to have been the result of a simple error in footwork.,construction  installing  thermal insulation  scaffold  ladder  fall  fall protection  fracture  rib  lung,1 315321224   Hospitalized injury Fracture Plumber  pipefitter and steamfiter apprentices FallDist: 8FallHt:8Cause: Installing metal sidingFatCause: Fall from/with ladder,apprentice,,,apprentice

201508561,Worker Amputates Thumb In Air,On May 10  2008  an employee was working at a facility operated by a  manufacturer or processor of prepared foods. He was assisting a coworker in  shutting down and disassembling the facility's Depot #4 so that it could be  cleaned. As part of the process  he removed a Definox brand control valve unit  from the production line. This valve had an internal coil spring that closed  the valve. Compressed air from an external supply overrode the spring force to  hold the valve open.

202532305,Two Employees Are Injured In Chemical Fire,At approximately 7:00 p.m. on September 23  2013  Employee #1 and #2 were  working at a chemical production facility. The production manager told a  coworker to place an obsolete trigonox 5-gallon container into the waste room.  The coworker poured the trigonox into a 55-gallon waste drum between 10:00  a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on that day. There were two waste drums (liquid and solid)  in the waste area adjacent to the compounding room. The liquid waste drum  contained left over liquid chemicals from a chemical batch that included  methyl methacrylate  ethyl acrylic  and trigonox 101  (2 5-Dimethyl-2 5-di(tert-butylperoxy)hexane). Both methyl methacrylate and  ethyl acrylic are flammable liquids. Around 7:00 p.m.  the chemicals in the  drum reacted and accelerated due to a catalyst in the drum. The runaway  reaction overpressurized the drum  causing it to fail and rupture and ejecting  drum lid. The drum lid struck the ceiling and hit a steam pipe  which resulted  in a fire. The vapors of methyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylic are heavier  than air  and travel down to the underground drain from the waste area into  the compounding room. Employee #1 was working at the filling station under the  hood in the compounding room. The fire from the underground drain melted  chemical filled plastic tubs on racks in the filling station. The fire had  grown bigger because there was more fuel (flammable chemicals) at the filling  station. Employee #1 tried to get out of the compounding room as fast as he  could after the fire. He suffered second-degree burns to his face and back of  his head  and third-degree burns to his right shoulder  arm  and fingers.  Employee #2 was in the compounding room to check Employee #1's work when fire  happened. The fire caused the power to shut down to the exit door. Employee #2  could not get out of the room. Other employees outside the compounding room  knew that he was inside the room  so they tried to push the door open. When  Employee #3 saw a crack of light at the door  he pushed himself to door and  got out of the room. Employee #3 suffered second-degree burns to his right  arm  third-degree burns to his right ear  right side of face  and serious  respiratory problems.

They began  to set up the crane and coworker #1 raised the 50 ft boom and swung it towards  the truck so that coworker #3 could release the travel slings from the main  and auxiliary lines. At this point the main block and the headache ball were  both approximately 1 ft from the truck  in between the truck and the crane.  The main block was approximately 25 ft above the ground and had two 20 ft  slings attached to lift the counterweights for the crane. Employee #1 was  standing on top of the stacked counterweights on the trailer  approximately 8  or 9 ft above the ground. He was inserting hooks that would be used to lift  the counterweights. The auxiliary line was hoisted with the 750 pound headache  ball attached to a height of approximately 40 ft in order to get it out of the  way.

At approximately 8:30 to 8:45 a.m.  Employee #1 began to  walk across the sales floor toward an elevator that would take her down to the  floor below  so she could use the bathroom. The employer had cordoned off  eight walkways on the sales floor between the area where Employee #1 was  working and the elevator bank with white  hard plastic chains  suspended at a  height of about 1.5 feet off the walkways  to prevent members of the cleaning  crew from entering secured areas while the alarms were set. The alarms were  off at the time of the accident  but the chains were still in place across the  eight walkways. Employee #1 had never been instructed regarding the purpose of  the eight chains or cautioned not to step over them. Employee #1 could have  reached the elevator without stepping over any of the barrier chains  but the  unobstructed path was about three or four times longer than the path blocked  by a chain. When Employee #1 arrived at Chain #5  she saw it and decided to  step over it  as she had done two or three times in the past.

14398168,Employees Overexposed To Vapors,"The supervisor for the night crew at Houston Industrial Services wanted more workers to help speed up a tank cleaning job. The company had depleted the local supplier's stock of appropriate respirators. Additional respirators were ordered from the Houston location. Because it was the weekend and after hours, the order was made through an on-call person. After confirmation with the on-site supervisor, the order was shipped to the work site.

Employee #1 and a coworker climbed a ladder to the platform  where the scales   vibrator  and radial feeder tray were located. Two other employees were  standing on the floor  one at the control panel  and one at the side of the  bucket elevator. Employee #1 and the coworker began cleaning the feeder tray  and the dispersion table  while standing up on the platform. In order to clean  the feeder tray better  Employee #1 put one foot on the white railing   attempting to raise herself up  so she could look into the feeder tray. As she  was putting her right foot on the railing  she placed her left hand on top of  the bucket elevator  near the chain and sprocket drive. At the same time  the  two employees on the floor level were removing the buckets from the bucket  elevator. Typically  in order to move the buckets along the line  the employee  at the control panel was turning the machine on  until four to six of the  buckets were within reach of the employee on the floor. Then  he would turn  the machine off using the black control button on the control panel  located  on the side of the machine. When the employee turned the machine on  Employee  #1's left hand was located on the unguarded chain and sprocket drive.

202457867,Worker Mixing Chemicals Is Burned When Solution Erupts,At approximately 3:45 a.m. on or about July 20  2012  Employee #1 was a  full-time permanent employee of a firm that made anti-corrosive coatings for  aircraft fasteners. Employee #1 was at tank #6. He was not just someone who  happened to be nearby. Instead  he was placing a powder form of a compound  known as Annro 101 into a 55-gallon (208-liter) PVC tank that contained  approximately 50 gallons (189 liters) of chemical solution. The chemical  solution's temperature was approximately 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees  Celsius). When Employee #1 introduced the Annro 101 into the chemical  solution  a nucleation occurred in the solution. The solution erupted and  struck Employee #1  who was standing approximately 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102  millimeters) from the tank when the eruption occurred. Employee #1 sustained  third-degree chemical burns on his head  face  and neck. The causal factors  were these: 1) The tank's heating element was on all of the time. 2) The  temperature indicator had malfunctioned. The indicator displayed a temperature  of approximately 179 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius)  when the  temperature was actually 205 to 209 degrees Fahrenheit (96 to 98 degrees  Celsius). 3) There was localized boiling around the unshielded heating  element. 4) The proper way to move the chemicals around to keep them mixed was  the use of compressed air bubbles.

The release occurred in  the kitchen 47 000 cu. ft. cold room when the facility was not occupied. At  first  Employee's entering the cold room did not detect or notice anything  wrong  however as the refrigerant migrated from the cold room into the warmer  cooking area  it expanded and filled the kitchen. Employee's in these warmer  areas were able to detect a sweet smell and then began experiencing upper  respiratory and eye irritations  which triggered an evacuation of the  facility. The refrigerant release was found to be the failure of the air  handler's evaporator coil that was abraded by an electrical conduit rubbing  against it.

He had been employed at this gin for  eight seasons  and during each of those seasons he would clean a gin line  every day at the end of his shift. At the time of the accident  he was working  on the night shift  which operated the gin from 7:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. At  6:00 a.m.  the gin shut down for cleaning. The gin consisted of four lines   which were controlled by the gin operator/foreman in a control booth on the  west side of the building. The regular procedure followed by this shift was  that the foreman would remain in the control booth and shut down the machines.  He would then tell the cleaning crew when they could begin. On the morning of  the accident  Employee #1 was cleaning line #4. He opened the front access  panel of the #86 Lummus lint cleaner and observed some lint that needed to be  removed. He did not notice that the saw had not yet come to a complete stop  after the shutdown.

201020294,Employee Injured In Fall,At approximately 11:00 a.m. on October 6  2004  Employee #1 and two other  nearby employees  Employee #2 and Employee #3  were all working at different  workstations approximately twenty feet apart at the Bergy Door & Window  Company. Employee #1 was preparing to trim the bottom of a solid core 3068  alder plank door. He put the door on the table of his workstation and then  started to reposition it. Picking the door up with both hands  he stepped back  from the table  felt his foot catch on something  and fell. Employee #3 had  his back to Employee #1 but  hearing a loud noise  knew from experience that a  door had fallen. He turned to see Employee #1 on the floor. He went over to  Employee #1  who said that he had been walking backward carrying the door and  tripped when his foot caught on the mat. Employee #3 and another employee  helped Employee #1 to his feet. Employee #1 stood holding the edge of the  table. Employee #1 didn't remember being in too much pain  although Employee  #3 remembered that Employee #1 complained of lightheadedness. Employee #1 was  taken to Kaiser Hospital  where it was determined that he required surgery for  a broken hip. The site is a door factory originally started by the current  employer's father in 1952. The current employer took the business over from  his father in 1972. Employees (millworkers) use table saws  radial arm saws   joiners  sanders  router and drills during the course of the workday. Work  hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The workday starts with a production  meeting after which the employees disperse to the various workstations. On the  day of the accident  Employee #1 reported to work as usual. Neither of two  witnesses reports anything unusual about him during the morning meeting  and  Employee #1 himself does not recall anything out of the ordinary. Employee #1  was working at a workstation different from the one he normally did. All  workstations  though  are essentially similar  and the work performed at each  is the same. The floor is concrete  and the area around each table is covered  with 0.375 in.-thick rubber mats to increase traction and ease the strain from  standing. At the time of the accident  Employee #1 was wearing safety goggles   gloves with a rubber face grip to help him hold doors  and track shoes.  Employee #1 walks with a shuffling gait due to neurological damage from a  prior stroke. It is possible that this gait disturbance did not allow him to  clear the edge of the mat  and when his right foot caught on the mat  the door  he was carrying overbalanced him and caused him to fall to the floor. Employee  #1 was employed off and on by the employer for a number of years. He was  recently rehired in 2003 and continued to work up until the day of the  accident. Regulatory Action and Accident-related Violations: There were no  accident related violations found as the result of this accident. The employer  was cited for a violation of 3203 (b)(2): Documentation of employee training  was not maintained. The accident was reported to Cal/OSHA in a timely fashion.  The Santa Rosa district office of Cal/OSHA was notified at 12:30 pm on October  7  2004  and an inspection was initiated on October 12  2004.,fall  hip  door  door machine  falling object  work station  ppe  walking backward  wood panel  foot,,,,,
202508719,Employee Is Crushed When Trapped By Drilling Rig,At 8:00 a.m. on July 5  2011  Employee #1 sustained a crushing injury to his  ribs. The accident site is a natural gas drilling well site where the employer  was servicing a well. The work at the time of injury was the setting up of the  drill rig over the natural gas well. Employee #1 and Employee #3 were placing  nuts on the blow out preventer. Employee #2 was spotting the drill rig as it  move backward. Employee #4 was the driver of the drilling rig. Employee #5   the supervisor  was walking away from the drill rig towards the Dog House  (i.e. trailer) at the time of the accident. The employees were beginning the  task of erecting the mast platform for Drill Rig #8. The employees began to  back the drilling rig's vertical platform into place at the back end of the  rig. The high pressure blow out preventer  which resembles a Christmas tree in  shape due to its extruding flanges and pipes  was put over the well head.  Employee #1 and Employee #3 began tightening a series of nuts requiring manual  tightening with large wrenches at the blow out devise. Employee #1 was wrench  tightening bolts to the blow out preventer as the drill rig slowly backed up.  Employee #2 was directing the drill rig driver  Employee #4  to the correct  location to set up over the well head. Employee #1 was out of view of the  drill rig driver  Employee #4. When Employee #4 attempted to put on the Drill  Rig #8's brakes to stop the drill rig  the air brakes failed to engage.  Employee #4 immediately knew the air brakes were not working  which caused him  to pull the drill rig's hand brake to stop the rig. The extra distance the  drill rig moved due to the faulty air brakes was approximately two feet. The  additional two feet moved was enough distance to trap Employee #1 between the  core of the blow out devise and the drill rig platform. Employee #1 sustained  a crushing injury with broken ribs and a possible concussion. The other  employees removed Employee #1 from the pinned position and kept Employee #1  still until medical care arrived. Employee #1 was hospitalized.,caught between  platform  drill rig--non-oil  fracture  rib  concussion  brake  crushed,,,,,

201163037,Employee Falls From Rooftop,On November 13  2001  employees working on new skylight assembly and  installation project  on roof of a building. The project was a dual employer  scenario. The employees working for Federated Logistics were installing  additional 800 new skylights on the rooftop of two-story-high warehouse  buildings to bring more daylight into the interior spaces. These new Solatube   were to be installed on the roof of building 'G'  'E' and 'C'. The new tubular  skylights that the employees were assembling were Solatube- Spectra light  2000. These 21 in  super reflective tubing produces 12 000 Lumen. There were  numerous 4 ft by 8 ft skylights already on the roof. The existing roofing of  bituminous waterproofing and metal decking  were cut out in circle using a  portable saw fitted with blade. After a brief break  Employee #1  #2 and #3  went back to the rooftop and started to cut new holes for the installation of  the new skylights. Employee #1 told Employee #2 and Employee #3 to prepare  everything and close the hole. Employee #1 was walking on the rooftop  and  accidentally stepped on one of the 4 ft by 8 ft existing plastic skylight  covering. The plastic gave way and the victim fell through the opening.

201508629,Employee Suffers Electric Shock From Underground Switchgear,On May 13  2008  Employee #1  who was a foreman  attempted to perform cable  splicing in an underground electrical vault  which contained a Trayer  submersible vacuum switchgear that had conductors energized at 12 000 volts.  The vault was located at a residential construction site in Fremont   California. According to Employee #1  who was the only witness on the day of  the accident  his immediate supervisor told him to connect cables to the  switchgear; therefore  he went to the switchgear to do the requested work.  Employee #1 opened the lid to the vault at approximately 8:30 a.m. Employee #1  placed a ladder into the vault to descend into the vault. Employee #1 stood on  the top of the switchgear and Employee #1 did not notice any vibration or  noise coming from the switchgear. This contributed to Employee #1 believing  the switchgear was not energized. Employee #1 proceeded to remove three candle  elbows for terminal conductor points or bushings on the switchgear so that  Employee #1 could begin connecting cables to the switchgear. When Employee #1  removed the third or last candle elbow  an electrical flash or large ball of  light occurred. The flash generated a loud bang. Employee #1 felt a  substantial amount of pain. Employee #1 tried to ascend the nearby ladder to  get out of the underground vault. Employee #2  who heard the loud bang  went  to help Employee #1 get out of the underground vault. Employee #3 called for  emergency assistance. The gloves worn by Employee #1 had holes/tears from the  electricity that entered/exited Employee #1's hands. The gloves were Tool  Handz PLUS Reinforced Snug-Fitting types. On the day of the accident  the  weather was sunny. There was no water in the underground vault. Employee #1  did not receive electrical safety training dealing with high voltage  equipment. Employee #1 is not certified as an electrician/electrical trainee  in the state of California. Employee #1 had never used any voltage testing  equipment to determine if conductors/equipment are energized. According to  Pacific Gas and Electric  which owns the switchgear  the accident resulted in  182 customers losing power. After the accident  Employee #1 was admitted to  Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley  California  but was later admitted to  Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose  California. Employee #1 was  admitted to both hospitals on May 13  2008. Employee #1 suffered third and  second degree burns to hands  and first degree burns to entire surface of the  face to the neck. Employee #1 also suffered temporary loss of hair on his head  and face. The employer failed to provide any electrical safety training  records for Employee #1 after the employer was given a request for safety  training records. The cause of the accident was Employee #1 performed  electrical work on energized equipment/switchgear without using proper safety  controls for energized equipment. These controls include using voltage testing  equipment before performing electrical work to determine if equipment was  energized  having only a qualified electrical worker perform work on high  voltage equipment  wearing safety gloves that are rated for voltage that may  be encountered  and following proper de-energizing provisions for work on high  voltage equipment.,electrocuted  electrical vault  burn  face  neck  hand  electrical testing  electric shock  untrained,1 310063912   Hospitalized injury Electric Shock Electricians FallDist: FallHt:Cause: Interior plumbing  ducting  electrical workFatCause: Electrocution from equipment installation/tool use,,,,

739920,Employees Exposed To Hydrogen Chloride Release,"On June 29, 1989, a mechanical failure in a processor at Dow Corning caused the compressor to divert to a scrubber. Due to insufficient water pressure in the scrubber, approximately 70 lb of hydrogen chloride was released over a 5 minute period. The chemical formed a cloud which was carried by the wind (which was blowing 10 mph from the east) to the Namex construction site approximately 800 yards away. (Namex is a part of Dow Corning). No alarm was sounded. The only warning sign was the cloud. Employees who saw the cloud alerted others and headed for the gates. Employees working on the structures or with their backs to the cloud had no warning until the odor from the cloud reached them. One employee was trapped on the cable tray throughout the entire 2 to 4 minutes of exposure. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital; 47 other exposed employees followed in cars shortly thereafter. Employees #1 through #48 were treated and released. Very few experienced any adverse health effects. With the exception of one employee, all were fully recovered by the next shift.

200210052,Employees Injured After Inhaling Hydrogen Fluoride,"Employees #1 through #7 were working between one and four blocks away from an alkylation unit, which was operating as usual. An worker in that unit had been instructed to block in the flow transmitter 83 FC 102, which was connected to a 2 in. internal hydrogen fluoride regeneration line at an orifice plate. He was to close the two 90 degree block valves, which were stubbed off the high and low sides of the flanged orifice plate, and open the two 90 degree bleed valves on both the high and low sides of the differential pressure instrument. According to the operators, there were no valve handles on the two 90 degree block valves because of physical interference from adjacent equipment. The worker that was to block in the instrument apparently failed to close one or both of the block valves before he opened the bleed valves. A vapor cloud of hydrogen fluoride developed. The leak continued for about five minutes, with the release of approximately 100 lb of hydrogen fluoride. A water deluge was used to minimize the vapor cloud. No injuries were reported in the alkylation unit, but Employees #1 through #7, who were working downwind, sustained minor inhalation injuries. On May 26, 1996, Citgo reported that all but two of the seven employees would be released from Memorial Hospital.

Employee #1 went to the operations office and was told that the blind  was ready to be pulled. Employee #2 gathered the proper tools and checked the  vacuum gauge to confirm that the line had 20 inches of vacuum. Neither the  maintenance supervisor nor the operations foreman initiated a fresh air permit  check  which would have indicated if type B protection would be necessary.  Instead  they believed that type C protection would be adequate since they had  used it on previous occasions for this job. Employee #1 used a wrench to  remove seven of the eight bolts holding the blind without any leakage. When he  removed the last bolt  hydrogen fluoride mist struck him in the face. Employee  #2 was standing by with the water hose and was also hit in the face by  hydrogen fluoride. Both employees suffered chemical burns and Employee #1 was  hospitalized. The bleeder line from this pump had become plugged and had never  been repaired. This meant that the upper side of the pump was still under  pressure and the vacuum was only being drawn from the lower side of the pump.

200261444,Employees Burned By Erupting Molten Metal,At approximately 11:34 a.m. on December 22  2000  Employee #1  #2 and #3 had  initiated a metal casting process in the casting pit when molten metal erupted  from the pit. The process was a semi-continuous direct chill casting process.  An electric arc casting furnace was used to melt copper raw material. The  copper was poured from the furnace into a launder (pouring tundish) and then  into three copper molds which were 11 in. in diameter and 19.44 in. long. The  final product was copper logs that were approximately 22.6 in. in length and  11 in. in diameter. The explosion involving the casting of the molten copper  process occurred in the East Casting Machine in Mold Number 6. The blast  forced the pivoted point of the launder upward and discharged most of the  copper from the mold. Prior to the explosion  the three employees were having  problems maintaining the proper flow rate into Mold Number 6 because of the  spout became clogged with debris. One of the employees used a lance rod to  clear the spout. While attempting to clear the spout and regulate the molten  copper flow into the mold  the explosion occurred and sprayed molten metal  upon the workers. They all received severe burns and were hospitalized. In the  hospital  they were treated for multiple burns located on various body  regions. From the inspection of the Casting Machine  the copper shell in the  Mold Number 6 after the explosion had become lodged within the mold and  separated from the mold cup. As for the log  it did not travel downwards with  the mold cup but left a space between the log and the mold cup. The creation  of a space between these two articles is likely due to water or condensation  being introduced into the mold cup. As the molten copper or formed copper log  contacted the moisture in the space  the heat caused the liquid to vaporize  causing a rapid expansion of super-heated steam. This steam forced its way  through a weak spot in the shell bottom and propelled the molten metal from  the mold.,molten metal  casting  pit  burn  metal ingot  forming machine,3 304038193   Hospitalized injury Burn/Scald(Heat) Occupation not reported,,,,

The cotton sweaters are water washed and the synthetic  sweaters are drycleaned; the Donini washing/drycleaning machines are single  units with both capabilities. Although the plant had been in operation since  January 1988  and the washing/drycleaning machines had been in place since  February 1988  the actual drycleaning operation was not run until April 11   1988. On April 12  1988  a Donini technician was on site to insure proper  functioning of the machines. Some of the employees noticed a strong odor from  the drycleaners and some experienced headaches. On April 13  the employees  noticed the same odor and symptoms. One employee fainted due to a heart  condition. On April 14  the drycleaners were started at 7:30 a.m. By 7:45 a.m.  the odor was very strong in various parts of the finishing room. At 8:15 a.m.   the doors in the room were opened  which helped control the odor. At 10:00  a.m.  numerous employees started experiencing nausea  headaches  vomiting   breathing problems  fainting  muscle weakness  and eye and throat irritation.  At approximately 1:00 p.m.  the plant was evacuated due to employees  experiencing fainting and severe reactions. Employee #3 was vomiting blood and  was transported to the hospital. EMTs transported 40 to 50 employees to the  hospital. Employees #1 through #27 were hospitalized and treated for  inhalation of perchloroethylene. Employee #10 was placed in intensive care due  to a pre-existing condition.

The machines are located in a 54 289 square ft room  with 14 ft ceilings. This same room contains sewing operations  steaming   inspection  and packaging; 75 employees work on each shift. There are three  HVAC units in the room  all with return air vents on the same side of the room  as the drycleaning units. No fresh air is brought in; all air is 100 percent  recycled through the HVAC systems. The incident was caused by poor design of  the finishing room; placement of the HVAC; and lack of makeup air.

201521234,Burn,An electrical contractor dispatched an electrician and an apprentice to a town  center mall to repair a defective 200-ampere fusible disconnect in a  low-voltage main distribution switchboard. In preparation  the employees  deenergized a 200-ampere electric power and lighting panelboard located on the  second level of the mall. The panelboard was fed by the defective disconnect   which had an open pole. Next  the electrician (Employee #1) opened the  disconnect switch  disconnected the load-side 3/0 AWG conductors  and  reconnected then to a 400-ampere disconnect in an adjacent section of the  switchgear. The electrician discovered that the A-phase internal bus hardware  of the defective 200-ampere switch  including the fuse holder  was discolored  from long-term overheating. This was similar to a problem he had encountered  less than a month ago at another 200-ampered fusible disconnect within the  same low-voltage switchboard. The problem with that disconnect  which was  directly above the disconnect on which he was working that day  was also on  the A-phase. Upon completion of these tasks  the electrician closed only the  400-ampere disconnect and called his employer to explain what he had found.  The employer (Employee #3) and the mechanical superintendent of the mall  (Employee #2) met the electrician at the switchboard. After explaining to them  his findings and making a recommendation to replace the defective switches or  to consider upgrading the entire service entrance switchgear  the electrician  closed the door to the switch he had deactivated that day. As he was closing  the door of the other defective switch  an electrical fault occurred. The  ensuing electric arc burned the two employees and the employer and knocked  them to the floor.

The high-heat shut-off valve was not  working or attached to the tank  which contained 1 1 1  trichloroethane. When  the hot side boiled down  exposing the heat elements  the tank began to smoke  and the alarms went off. Employees were coughing and feeling ill but did not  leave the building when the alarms sounded. The fire department arrived and  opened the remaining doors to ventilate the building. When the paramedics  arrived  they transported Employees #1 through #4 to the hospital  where they  were treated and released. The owners of the company arrived and inspected the  area inside for a half an hour.

Dock #7 was not in use and all entrances  to it had allegedly been taped off or chained off and warning signs provided.  Employee #1 went to get the sling where the tool had been left. When on the  second level  he stepped on a board in the area where the tail section of an  aircraft would be if a jet was docked. The board gave way because the rail  supports underneath were not in place. Employee #1 fell about 20 feet and  landed on a dumpster.

14202345,Concrete Floor Slab Collapse While Being Removed From Below,On March 13  1987  three employees were cutting and removing a section of  concrete slab flooring in a paper mill. The section being removed was  approximately 30 ft by 10 ft with a thickness of 8 inches. Due to the paper  machine being located on the floor and being kept in operation during this  process  the work being done by the three employees was being done from below  or under the floor being removed. The employees were cutting  coring and  removing this 30 ft by 10 ft section in approximately 6 ft by 4 ft sections.  Ten of these sections had been successfully removed prior to the accident.  During the removal of the last two sections  an unplanned collapse occurred  resulting in approximately a 6 ft by 10 ft section of floor slab falling and  striking the three employees working below it. The three employees were on  scaffolding or a staging work platform. It is possible that this accident  occurred during the process of removing the ceiling jacks or braces and  installation of the forklift unit which was being used to remove sections.  Employee #1 was seriously injured sustaining a severely broken left leg and  right ankle. Employee #2 sustained minor bruises and a broken rib as he pushed  Employee #3 clear of the falling slab. Causal factors included lack of written  demolition plan  lack of adequate underpinning and possible lack of adequate  supervision on site at the time of the accident. Also  a lack of rebar at the  breaking point of the concrete slab was found.,paper machine  concrete slab  industrial truck  scaffolding  collapse  ceiling  fracture  rebar  contusion  underpinning,3 105320683   Non Hospitalized injury Bruise/Contus/Abras Construction trades  n.e.c.,,,,
202551131,Employee Is Burned By Pressurized Food Flavoring,"On October 27  2009  Employee #1  who had been a permanent employee of a food  flavoring manufacture for more than five years and had no other contracts  was  performing his duties as a cook operator. Employee #1 was cooking a batch of  Natural Lemon (""WONF 858452"") in Durarome Reactor #3  in the Redline Cook  Department. According to Employee #1  Employee #3  a maintenance mechanic   informed Employee #2 but not him about a lockout/tagout procedure that would  take place and affect the cooking done by Employees #1 and #2 at Reactor #3.  In addition  the employer did not complete a required lockout/tagout permit.  Employee #1 indicated that he was cooking with the drop legs open  so that any  pressure build up would be relieved through the drop legs and back to the  upstream mixer. However  Employee #3 was working on compressed air lines that  powered all reactor steam and vent valves  including those that led to the  reactor vent line and would have normally allowed pressure created by the  heated sugar to escape safely to an upstream mixer. Employee #1 knew that the  initial line pressure of 70 psi to 80 psi had dropped to 1 psi to 20 psi.  However  he was at the end of the cooking process  and it was time to add oil  to the batch. Employee #1 turned off Reactor #2  including the shear blades  and steam  at the switch board. Employee #1 unscrewed the vent pipe  which was  shaped like a candy cane and apparently transported pressurized product safely  from Reactor #2 to the floor. Employee #1 said that anytime he anticipated  pressure build up  he would first open the port valve  but since he had not  anticipated pressure  he first loosened the candy cane-shaped vent pipe.  Because the valves were closed  the pressure could only be released through  the port of Reactor #2. The pressurized product contacted the back of Employee  #1's right hand and caused a third degree burn. Employee #1 was hospitalized  for more than 24 hours and he underwent two skin graft surgeries. The employer  reported the serious incident to the division on November 3  2009.",burn  hand  high pressure  high temperature  heat  lockout  pressure release  valve  venting,,,,,
